{"s1":{"h":"What PDF Editing Really Means","p":"PDF editing encompasses several different activities, and understanding these distinctions helps you choose the right tool. True text editingâmodifying the actual text content of a PDFârequires specialized software and is complex because PDFs store text as positioned graphics rather than editable text flows.\n\nMore commonly, PDF editing refers to adding annotations, highlights, comments, and sticky notes. Form filling is another major category, allowing you to complete fillable PDF forms. Adding signatures, stamps, and images qualifies as PDF editing. Rearranging, rotating, or deleting pages counts as structural editing. Most users need these latter capabilities rather than full text editing. Tuttilo's PDF Editor focuses on these practical, everyday editing needs that don't require expensive software."},"s2":{"h":"Filling PDF Forms Online","p":"PDF forms are ubiquitousâtax documents, applications, contracts, and surveys all commonly use fillable PDF format. Traditional form filling required printing, handwriting, and scanning. Modern online editors like Tuttilo streamline this process entirely.\n\nTo fill a PDF form with Tuttilo, upload your form document through the PDF Editor tool. The editor automatically detects fillable form fields and allows you to click directly into text boxes, checkboxes, and dropdown menus. Type naturally as you would in any form. For forms without pre-defined fields, use the text tool to add text anywhere on the document. You can customize font, size, and color to match the document's style. Once complete, download the filled form as a new PDF, ready for submission."},"s3":{"h":"Adding Annotations and Comments","p":"Annotations transform PDFs from static documents into collaborative workspaces. Highlight important passages with the highlighter tool, choosing from multiple colors to categorize information. Add text comments to explain edits, ask questions, or provide feedback.\n\nThe sticky note feature lets you attach expandable notes that don't obscure underlying content. Draw freehand with the pen tool to circle items, draw arrows, or sketch diagrams. Use shapesârectangles, circles, arrowsâto emphasize sections or create flowcharts. The text box tool adds larger text blocks for extensive commentary. All annotations are non-destructive; they layer over the original content without modifying it. This makes PDF annotation perfect for document review, editing suggestions, and collaborative feedback."},"s4":{"h":"Signing PDF Documents Electronically","p":"Electronic signatures have legal validity in most jurisdictions and eliminate the print-sign-scan workflow. Tuttilo's PDF Editor offers multiple signature methods to suit different needs and preferences.\n\nThe draw signature option lets you sign using your mouse, trackpad, or touchscreen, mimicking handwritten signatures. The type signature feature creates a signature from text using script fonts that resemble handwriting. Upload signature lets you photograph your handwritten signature and insert it as an image. Once created, signatures can be resized and positioned anywhere on the document. You can save frequently-used signatures for quick insertion across multiple documents. Add dates, initials, and company stamps the same way. Downloaded PDFs retain all signatures permanently."},"s5":{"h":"Working with Images and Stamps","p":"Adding images to PDFs serves many purposesâlogos for branding, photos for reports, stamps for approval, or watermarks for protection. Tuttilo's image insertion tool supports common formats including JPEG, PNG, and SVG.\n\nUpload images from your device or drag them directly into the editor. Resize images by dragging corner handles while maintaining aspect ratio. Position images precisely using drag-and-drop or arrow keys for fine adjustment. Layer images above or below text and other elements. Common use cases include adding company logos to invoices, inserting diagrams into reports, placing approval stamps on reviewed documents, and adding profile photos to applications. You can also add text watermarks for draft versions or confidential markings."},"s6":{"h":"Privacy and Security Considerations","p":"When editing sensitive documents like contracts, financial statements, or personal applications, security matters. Many online PDF editors upload your files to servers for processing, creating privacy risks and compliance issues.\n\nTuttilo's PDF Editor processes everything directly in your browser using client-side JavaScript. Your PDF never uploads to any serverâit stays on your device throughout the editing process. This approach ensures complete privacy and works offline once the page loads. Your edits process instantly without waiting for server responses. No file size limits exist beyond your device's memory capacity. This client-side architecture complies with data protection regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. When you close the browser tab, no trace of your document remains on any server because it was never uploaded in the first place."},"title":"How to Edit PDF Files Online for Free: Complete 2026 Guide","excerpt":"Discover how to edit, annotate, fill forms, and sign PDF documents directly in your browser.
