{"s1":{"h":"Understanding QR Code Types","p":"QR codes store different types of information depending on their purpose. URL QR codes, the most common type, link to websites when scanned. Simply encode any web address and users can visit with a single scanâno typing required. WiFi QR codes contain network credentials, allowing guests to connect to your network without manually entering passwords.\n\nContact card (vCard) QR codes store complete contact information including name, phone, email, address, and company details. Scanning automatically creates a new contact in the user's phone. Text QR codes contain plain messages that display when scanned. Email QR codes create pre-filled email drafts with recipient, subject, and message. SMS QR codes compose text messages to specific numbers. Phone number QR codes trigger calls when scanned. Location QR codes open map applications to specific coordinates. Each type serves distinct purposes, and Tuttilo's QR Code Generator supports all major formats."},"s2":{"h":"Creating Your First QR Code with Tuttilo","p":"Generating a QR code with Tuttilo takes seconds and requires no technical expertise. Visit tuttilo.com and navigate to the QR Code Generator in the Utilities or Tools category. Select the type of QR code you want to create from the dropdown menuâURL, WiFi, contact card, text, email, or SMS.\n\nEnter the relevant information in the input fields. For URLs, paste the complete web address including https://. For WiFi codes, enter your network name (SSID), password, and select the security type (WPA, WEP, or none). For contact cards, fill in the available fieldsâname, phone, email, organization, and address. After entering your information, the QR code generates automatically. Download the code as PNG or SVG format. PNG works for most uses, while SVG provides vector scalability for professional printing."},"s3":{"h":"Customization Options and Branding","p":"Modern QR codes extend beyond basic black-and-white squares. Customization helps QR codes match your brand identity and attract more scans. Color customization allows you to change both foreground and background colors. Maintain high contrastâdark foreground on light background ensures reliable scanning.\n\nMany generators including Tuttilo allow adding logos or images to the QR code center. The logo should occupy no more than 20-30% of the total code area to preserve scannability. QR codes contain error correction, allowing them to function even with partially obscured sectionsâthis feature enables logo embedding. Customize the corner patterns and data dot styles for distinctive appearances. Round dots instead of square pixels create softer, more modern aesthetics. Frame your QR code with a border and add a call-to-action text like 'Scan Me' or 'Visit Our Website' to increase scan rates."},"s4":{"h":"QR Code Use Cases and Applications","p":"Business cards with QR codes save contacts instantlyâno more manually typing information from paper cards. Add a vCard QR code to your card, email signature, or website. Restaurants use QR codes for digital menus, eliminating printed menu costs and enabling instant updates.\n\nRetail packaging includes QR codes linking to product information, tutorials, warranty registration, and customer support. Event tickets increasingly use QR codes for contactless check-in and validation. Marketing materials like posters, flyers, and advertisements use QR codes to drive traffic from physical to digital spaces. Real estate signs include QR codes linking to virtual tours and property details. Museums and galleries provide QR codes for audio guides and extended information. Product authentication uses unique QR codes to verify genuine items. Payment systems like PayPal and cryptocurrency wallets use QR codes for transaction initiation."},"s5":{"h":"Best Practices for Printing QR Codes","p":"Print quality directly affects scannability. Use high-resolution imagesâat least 300 DPI for print, and never scale up low-resolution codes. Download SVG format for professional printing since vector formats scale infinitely without quality loss. Maintain minimum size requirements: 2x2 cm (0.8x0.8 inches) for close-range scanning, larger for distance scanning.\n\nEnsure sufficient quiet zoneâthe white border around the QR code should be at least four modules (four times the width of the smallest squares) wide. Test printed codes before mass production using multiple devices and scanning apps. Matte finishes scan more reliably than glossy surfaces that create reflections. Avoid placing QR codes on curved, wrinkled, or textured surfaces that distort the pattern. For outdoor use, weather-resistant materials and UV-resistant inks prevent fading. Consider placement heightâcodes should be at comfortable scanning height, typically chest to eye level."},"s6":{"h":"Testing and Tracking QR Code Performance","p":"Always test QR codes before distribution. Scan with multiple devices running iOS and Android to ensure cross-platform compatibility. Test in various lighting conditionsâbright sunlight can cause glare, while low light may prevent camera focus. Verify that the encoded information is correct by checking where scanned codes lead.\n\nFor business applications, consider using dynamic QR codes that allow changing the destination URL without reprinting the code. While Tuttilo generates static codes, third-party services offer dynamic codes with analytics tracking. Track how many times codes are scanned, when, where, and from which devices. This data helps measure campaign effectiveness. For long-term use, periodically verify that linked content remains accessibleâbroken links frustrate users. Monitor analytics to understand engagement patterns and optimize placement and design accordingly."},"title":"How to Create Custom QR Codes: Complete Guide for 2026","excerpt":"Learn to generate professional QR codes for URLs, WiFi, contact cards, and more.
