{"s1":{"h":"Understanding Hash Functions","p":"Hash functions create fixed-length digital fingerprints from input data of any size—same input always produces identical hash, different inputs produce different hashes (ideally). Hash functions are one-way—you cannot reverse a hash to recover original data. Hashing enables verifying data integrity (detecting changes) and securing passwords. MD5 produces 128-bit (16-byte) hashes appearing as 32 hexadecimal characters. SHA-256 produces 256-bit (32-byte) hashes appearing as 64 hexadecimal characters. Larger hash size provides better security against collisions (different inputs producing same hash)."},"s2":{"h":"MD5 History and Vulnerabilities","p":"MD5 was released in 1992 and dominated hashing for years due to computational speed and simplicity. MD5 produces smaller hashes (128-bit) requiring less storage and transmission. However, MD5 is cryptographically broken—researchers demonstrated practical collision attacks where different inputs produce identical MD5 hashes. This vulnerability means MD5 cannot reliably detect data modification or authenticate files. NIST officially deprecated MD5 for cryptographic use in 2004. While MD5 remains useful for non-security applications (checksums for non-critical data), using MD5 for security is dangerous and irresponsible."},"s3":{"h":"SHA-256 Security and Advantages","p":"SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) was designed to address MD5's vulnerabilities and remains cryptographically secure. SHA-256's larger output space (2^256 possible hashes versus 2^128 for MD5) makes collision attacks computationally infeasible with current technology. SHA-256 is NIST-approved and government-standard for security applications. No practical attacks against SHA-256 have been demonstrated despite extensive cryptographic research. SHA-256 computation is slightly slower than MD5 but remains computationally efficient on modern hardware. SHA-256 is industry standard for blockchain (Bitcoin uses SHA-256), digital signatures, and security-critical applications."},"s4":{"h":"Performance Implications","p":"MD5 is faster than SHA-256—MD5 may hash large files slightly quicker on resource-constrained devices. However, modern computers complete SHA-256 hashing in milliseconds for typical file sizes—performance difference is negligible for most applications. Network and disk I/O typically dominate performance, not hashing speed. Choosing weaker security for minor performance gains is poor engineering practice. SHA-256 performance is acceptable for all practical applications including high-volume server operations. Never sacrifice security for trivial performance improvements—security benefits vastly outweigh minor speed differences."},"s5":{"h":"Practical Applications and Use Cases","p":"Use SHA-256 for password storage, digital signatures, certificate generation, blockchain, and any security-critical application. Use SHA-256 for verifying file integrity when security matters. MD5 remains acceptable for non-security checksums (detecting corruption from transmission errors), version control systems treating hashes as identifiers rather than security mechanisms, and legacy systems where replacement isn't feasible. New applications must use SHA-256 or stronger (SHA-3, Bcrypt for passwords). Audit existing systems for MD5 usage and replace with SHA-256 during maintenance."},"s6":{"h":"Future-Proofing Security Decisions","p":"Security standards evolve as cryptographic knowledge advances. Current recommendations favor SHA-256 for general purposes and specialized algorithms (Bcrypt, PBKDF2, Argon2) for password hashing. Assume current algorithms will eventually require replacement—design systems enabling future algorithm updates. Store algorithm information with hashes enabling verification with appropriate function. Monitor NIST and security organization recommendations for emerging threats. Implement security updates promptly when vulnerabilities are discovered. Relying on deprecated algorithms despite known vulnerabilities demonstrates negligent security practice—avoid the temptation to maintain legacy systems indefinitely."},"title":"MD5 vs SHA-256: Comparação de Funções Hash e Guia de Segurança","excerpt":"Aprenda as diferenças entre as funções hash MD5 e SHA-256."}
