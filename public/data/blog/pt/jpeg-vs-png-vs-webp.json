{"s1":{"h":"Understanding Image Format Basics","p":"Image formats determine how visual data is stored and compressed, directly impacting file size, quality, and compatibility. JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) has been the web standard since 1992, PNG (Portable Network Graphics) emerged in 1996 as a patent-free alternative to GIF, and WebP is Google's modern format released in 2010. Each format uses different compression algorithms optimized for different image types. Understanding strengths and weaknesses of each helps you choose appropriate format for specific applications and requirements."},"s2":{"h":"JPEG Format Characteristics","p":"JPEG uses lossy compression, removing some image data to achieve small file sizes—typically 80% smaller than PNG for photographs. Quality setting (0-100) controls compression ratio and quality trade-off. JPEG works exceptionally well for photographs, complex images with many colors, and scenarios where file size matters. Universal compatibility across devices and platforms makes JPEG practical for web and email. JPEG doesn't support transparency or lossless editing—each save cycle may degrade quality. For continuous editing workflows, preserve original files and export to JPEG only for final distribution."},"s3":{"h":"PNG Format Characteristics","p":"PNG uses lossless compression, preserving all image information while still reducing file size compared to uncompressed formats. Supports 8-bit (256 colors), 24-bit (millions of colors), and 32-bit (with transparency) images. Transparency support via alpha channel enables PNG images to display on any background without white boxes. Ideal for graphics, logos, screenshots, and images requiring sharp edges and text. Larger file sizes than JPEG for photographs but essential for transparency and quality-critical applications. PNG works across all modern platforms and browsers with universal support."},"s4":{"h":"WebP Format Characteristics","p":"WebP is modern format combining best aspects of JPEG and PNG, offering superior compression for both lossy and lossless scenarios. WebP files are 25-35% smaller than JPEG while maintaining quality, and 26% smaller than PNG for lossless compression. Supports transparency like PNG while achieving JPEG-like compression. Browser support approaches universality but older browsers (Internet Explorer, older Safari) require fallbacks. Ideal for modern web applications where file size and loading speed matter. Many CDNs and web hosts optimize delivery using WebP format with automatic fallbacks for older browsers."},"s5":{"h":"When to Use Each Format","p":"Use JPEG for photographs, complex images with many colors, and scenarios prioritizing file size over transparency. Use PNG for graphics, logos, screenshots, icons, and any images requiring transparency or perfect quality preservation. Use WebP for modern web applications where browser support is adequate and file size is critical. Consider fallback strategies when using WebP—serve JPEG to unsupported browsers while delivering WebP to modern browsers. Some applications require specific formats regardless of optimization—follow platform requirements (e-commerce sites, archives, professional publications) even if another format might be technically superior."},"s6":{"h":"Format Conversion Strategies","p":"Choose source format based on quality requirements—high-quality sources enable better results regardless of output format. Converting from JPEG to PNG doesn't improve quality—PNG just stores JPEG artifacts losslessly. Always convert from original or highest-quality available source. When converting photographs to PNG, file size may increase significantly—consider whether benefits outweigh drawbacks. Converting to WebP requires modern tools and browser testing to ensure compatibility. For multi-format requirements, maintain original high-quality file and export to different formats as needed rather than converting between formats. This preserves maximum flexibility and quality throughout your workflow."},"title":"JPEG vs PNG vs WebP: Guia Completo de Comparação de Formatos de Imagem","excerpt":"Entenda as diferenças entre os formatos JPEG, PNG e WebP."}
