{"s1":{"h":"O Que Realmente Significa Editar PDF","p":"PDF editing encompasses several different activities, and understanding these distinctions helps you choose the right tool. True text editing—modifying the actual text content of a PDF—requires specialized software and is complex because PDFs store text differently than word processors. Form filling involves entering data into pre-designed fillable fields, which is straightforward and works in most browsers. Annotation includes highlighting, adding comments, drawing marks, and inserting images—features that layer over the original PDF without modifying its core content. Signature addition allows inserting digital signatures for document authentication. Understanding these different editing types ensures you use the right tool for your specific needs."},"s2":{"h":"Preenchendo Formulários PDF Online","p":"PDF forms are ubiquitous—tax documents, applications, contracts, and surveys all commonly use fillable PDF format. Traditional form filling required printing, handwriting, and scanning. Modern online editors like Tuttilo streamline this process entirely. Open your PDF form in the Tuttilo PDF Editor and you'll immediately see available fillable fields highlighted. Click each field and type the required information. The editor recognizes different field types—text fields for typed input, checkboxes for binary selections, dropdown menus for predefined options, and radio buttons for single selections. Your completed form remains editable until you're satisfied with the content, allowing easy corrections and modifications before finalizing."},"s3":{"h":"Adicionando Anotações e Comentários","p":"Annotations transform PDFs from static documents into collaborative workspaces. Highlight important passages with the highlighter tool, choosing from multiple colors to categorize information. Add text comments to explain edits, ask questions, or provide feedback without modifying the original document text. Use the drawing tools to circle, underline, or draw arrows pointing to specific content requiring attention. Insert text boxes with notes, recommendations, or corrections positioned anywhere on the page. These annotation features enable collaborative review processes where multiple team members can review and comment on documents without altering the original content, perfect for document approval workflows and peer review scenarios."},"s4":{"h":"Assinando Documentos Digitalmente","p":"Digital signatures add a layer of authenticity and legal validity to PDF documents. Tuttilo's PDF Editor supports adding digital signatures without requiring certificates or complex setup. Simply open your document, select the signature tool, and draw or type your signature directly onto the PDF. Digital signatures work across devices and platforms, making it convenient to sign documents without printing and rescanning. Recipients can verify when the document was signed and confirm it hasn't been altered since signature addition. This feature eliminates printing, signing, and scanning workflows for contract approvals, permission forms, and document authorizations."},"s5":{"h":"Extraindo Texto de PDFs","p":"Extracting text from PDF documents enables reuse of content without manual retyping. This feature proves invaluable for repurposing document content into presentations, reports, or articles. Simply select the text you want to extract and copy it directly. The extracted text maintains formatting when possible, though complex layouts might require minor adjustments. This capability works especially well with digitally-created PDFs; scanned documents require OCR technology for accurate text extraction, which most modern tools now include. Text extraction respects document permissions, ensuring extracted content doesn't violate copyright or licensing restrictions."},"s6":{"h":"Segurança e Permissões de PDF","p":"PDFs support various security features protecting document content and controlling user access. Password protection prevents unauthorized opening of documents, useful for confidential information. Permission settings restrict what users can do with the document—preventing printing, copying text, or further editing while allowing reading. These security features ensure sensitive documents remain protected even after distribution. Tuttilo's PDF Editor respects and displays these security settings, helping you understand document restrictions before making changes. Creating password-protected PDFs requires appropriate tools, but most modern PDF editors provide straightforward interfaces for adding security protection."},"title":"Como Editar Arquivos PDF Online Gratuitamente: Guia Completo 2026","excerpt":"Descubra como editar, anotar, preencher formulários e assinar documentos PDF diretamente no seu navegador."}
