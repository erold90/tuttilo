{"q1":"How does fraction simplification work?","a1":"We find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator, then divide both by it to get the simplified form.","q2":"Can I use whole numbers?","a2":"Yes, leave the denominator as 1 (or empty) to use whole numbers in calculations.","q3":"What is a mixed number?","a3":"A mixed number combines a whole number with a proper fraction, like 2 3/4 instead of 11/4.","q4":"What happens with division by zero?","a4":"Division by zero is undefined and will show no result. The calculator handles this gracefully.","q5":"Can I do negative fractions?","a5":"Yes, enter negative numbers for the numerator to work with negative fractions."}
