{"q1":"What is a file hash?","a1":"A file hash is a unique fingerprint generated from the file contents using a cryptographic algorithm. Even a tiny change in the file produces a completely different hash.","q2":"Which hash algorithm should I use?","a2":"SHA-256 is the most commonly used for file verification. SHA-1 is older and less secure. SHA-384 and SHA-512 offer stronger security.","q3":"Is the file uploaded anywhere?","a3":"No, all hash computation happens in your browser using the Web Crypto API. Your files never leave your device.","q4":"Why does MD5 not appear?","a4":"MD5 is not supported by the Web Crypto API and is considered cryptographically broken. We use SHA family algorithms which are more secure."}
