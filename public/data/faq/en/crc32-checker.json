{"q1":"What is CRC32?","a1":"CRC32 (Cyclic Redundancy Check 32-bit) is a checksum algorithm that produces a 32-bit (8 hex character) value used to detect data corruption.","q2":"Is CRC32 secure?","a2":"No. CRC32 is designed for error detection, not security. Use SHA-256 or similar for cryptographic purposes.","q3":"What file formats use CRC32?","a3":"CRC32 is used in ZIP archives, PNG images, Ethernet frames, MPEG-2 streams, and many other formats for integrity checking.","q4":"Can I check large files?","a4":"Yes, files up to 100MB are supported. The calculation runs entirely in your browser.","q5":"Why do I get different results for the same text?","a5":"Ensure you are using the same encoding. This tool uses UTF-8 encoding for text input. Trailing spaces or newlines can also change the result."}
