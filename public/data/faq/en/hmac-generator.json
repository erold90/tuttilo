{"q1":"What is HMAC?","a1":"HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is a cryptographic construction that uses a secret key and a hash function to produce an authentication code.","q2":"Which algorithm should I use?","a2":"SHA-256 is the most common choice, offering a good balance of security and performance. Use SHA-512 for maximum security.","q3":"Is HMAC the same as hashing?","a3":"No. Regular hashing only ensures integrity. HMAC uses a secret key, so it also ensures authenticity — only someone with the key can produce a valid HMAC.","q4":"Is this tool secure?","a4":"Yes. All computation uses the Web Crypto API and runs entirely in your browser. No data is sent to any server.","q5":"Where is HMAC used?","a5":"HMAC is used in JWT tokens, API authentication (AWS Signature), webhook verification (GitHub, Stripe), TLS, and many other security protocols."}
