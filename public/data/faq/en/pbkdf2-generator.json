{"q1":"What is PBKDF2?","a1":"PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) is a standard algorithm (RFC 2898) that converts a password into a cryptographic key by applying a hash function many times with a salt.","q2":"How many iterations should I use?","a2":"OWASP recommends at least 600,000 iterations for SHA-256 as of 2023. Higher values are more secure but slower. 100,000 is a reasonable minimum.","q3":"What is a salt?","a3":"A salt is random data added to the password before hashing. It ensures that identical passwords produce different derived keys, preventing rainbow table attacks.","q4":"PBKDF2 vs bcrypt vs Argon2?","a4":"All are password hashing algorithms. Argon2 is newest and recommended. bcrypt is well-established. PBKDF2 is the most widely supported and available natively in browsers.","q5":"Is this secure for password storage?","a5":"PBKDF2 with high iteration count and a unique salt per password is suitable for password storage, though Argon2id is now preferred for new applications."}
