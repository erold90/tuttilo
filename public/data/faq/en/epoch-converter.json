{"q1":"What is a Unix epoch timestamp?","a1":"A Unix epoch timestamp is the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC. It is widely used in computing to represent dates and times.","q2":"What is the difference between seconds and milliseconds?","a2":"Unix timestamps in seconds are 10 digits (e.g., 1700000000) while milliseconds are 13 digits (e.g., 1700000000000). Our tool auto-detects the format.","q3":"What is the Year 2038 problem?","a3":"The Year 2038 problem occurs because 32-bit systems store Unix time as a signed 32-bit integer, which overflows on January 19, 2038. Modern 64-bit systems are not affected."}
