{"q1":"What is a MAC address?","a1":"A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique 48-bit identifier assigned to network interfaces, typically displayed as 6 hex pairs.","q2":"What is the unicast bit?","a2":"The least significant bit of the first byte. When 0 (unicast), the address represents a single device. When 1 (multicast), it represents a group.","q3":"What is locally administered?","a3":"The second least significant bit of the first byte. When set, it indicates the MAC was assigned locally rather than by the manufacturer.","q4":"Can I use generated MACs for testing?","a4":"Yes, these are ideal for testing, development, and virtual machine configuration. Use locally administered unicast MACs to avoid conflicts."}
