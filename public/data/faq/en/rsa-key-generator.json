{"q1":"What key size should I use?","a1":"2048-bit is the current standard minimum. Use 4096-bit for higher security. 1024-bit is considered weak and should only be used for testing.","q2":"Are the keys secure?","a2":"Yes. Keys are generated using your browser native Web Crypto API with cryptographically secure random number generation. Nothing is sent to a server.","q3":"What format are the keys in?","a3":"Public keys use SPKI format, private keys use PKCS#8 format, both encoded as PEM (Base64 with headers). Compatible with OpenSSL and most tools.","q4":"Can I use these keys for SSH?","a4":"The generated keys are in PKCS#8/SPKI PEM format. You may need to convert them to OpenSSH format using ssh-keygen for SSH use.","q5":"Why does 4096-bit take longer?","a5":"Larger key sizes require finding larger prime numbers, which is computationally intensive. 4096-bit keys may take a few seconds to generate."}
