{"q1":"What animation presets are available?","a1":"Eight presets: Bounce (up-down), Fade In (opacity), Slide In (left to right), Rotate (360° spin), Pulse (scale), Shake (horizontal), Zoom In (scale from 0), and Flip (3D Y-axis rotation).","q2":"Can I customize the animation speed?","a2":"Yes, use the duration slider to set the animation speed from 0.1 seconds to 3 seconds. Each preset has an optimized default duration that you can adjust.","q3":"What are timing functions?","a3":"Timing functions control the acceleration curve of the animation. Linear runs at constant speed. Ease starts slow, speeds up, then slows down. Ease-in starts slow. Ease-out ends slow. Ease-in-out does both.","q4":"How do I use the generated CSS?","a4":"Copy the output which includes the @keyframes rule and the animation property. Paste the keyframes at the top of your CSS file and add the animation property to your element selector.","q5":"Can I set how many times the animation runs?","a5":"Yes, choose from infinite (loops forever), or 1, 2, 3, or 5 iterations. Use infinite for continuous effects like loading spinners, or a fixed count for one-time entrance animations."}
