{"q1":"Can I set different values for each corner?","a1":"Yes, uncheck the \"Link Corners\" option to control each corner independently. You can set top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-left to different values for asymmetric designs.","q2":"What units are supported?","a2":"Three units: px (pixels, fixed size), % (percentage, responsive), and rem (root em, scales with font size). Choose the unit that best fits your project.","q3":"How do I make a perfect circle?","a3":"Set border-radius to 50% on a square element. Use the % unit and set all corners to 50% to achieve a perfect circle.","q4":"What is the shorthand syntax?","a4":"When all corners are equal, the generator outputs a single value like \"border-radius: 16px\". When different, it uses the shorthand: \"border-radius: TL TR BR BL\" in clockwise order.","q5":"Does this work with all browsers?","a5":"Yes, border-radius is supported by all modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. No vendor prefixes are needed."}
