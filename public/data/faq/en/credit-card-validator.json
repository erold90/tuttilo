{"q1":"What is the Luhn algorithm?","a1":"The Luhn algorithm (also known as modulus 10) is a checksum formula used to validate identification numbers including credit card numbers.","q2":"Is this tool safe to use?","a2":"Yes. All validation happens locally in your browser. No data is sent to any server or stored anywhere.","q3":"Can this tool process payments?","a3":"No. This tool only validates the number format. It cannot check if a card is active, has funds, or process any transaction.","q4":"How does card type detection work?","a4":"Card networks use specific number ranges (BIN/IIN). For example, Visa cards start with 4, Mastercard with 51-55 or 2221-2720.","q5":"Why is my test card number invalid?","a5":"The number must pass the Luhn checksum. Many randomly typed numbers will fail. Use known test card numbers from payment processor documentation."}
