{"q1":"How secure is AES-256?","a1":"AES-256 is considered unbreakable by brute force with current technology. It is used by governments and military organizations worldwide.","q2":"Can I decrypt on another device?","a2":"Yes. Copy the encrypted output and paste it on any device with this tool. Use the same password to decrypt.","q3":"What happens if I forget the password?","a3":"The data cannot be recovered without the password. There is no backdoor or recovery mechanism.","q4":"Is my data sent to a server?","a4":"No. All encryption and decryption happens locally in your browser using the Web Crypto API.","q5":"What is PBKDF2?","a5":"PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) converts your password into a strong encryption key using 100,000 iterations of hashing with a random salt."}
