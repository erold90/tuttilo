Each discount applies to the already-reduced price, not the original price.","q3":"Are stacked discounts better than a single combined discount?","a3":"No, stacked discounts result in a smaller total discount. 20% + 10% stacked = 28% effective, which is less than a single 30% discount.","q4":"Is sales tax applied before or after the discount?","a4":"Sales tax is applied after all discounts are taken, on the final discounted price.
