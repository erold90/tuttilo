{"q1":"What video formats are supported?","a1":"The tool supports MP4, WebM and most common video formats. Simply upload your video and select the portion you want to convert to GIF.","q2":"How can I control the GIF file size?","a2":"Use the FPS and width controls. Lower FPS (5-10) and smaller width (320px) create smaller files. Higher FPS (15-20) and larger width (640px) produce smoother, larger GIFs.","q3":"Is there a duration limit?","a3":"There is no hard limit, but GIFs are best for short clips (3-15 seconds). Longer clips create very large files. The tool supports videos up to 200 MB."}
