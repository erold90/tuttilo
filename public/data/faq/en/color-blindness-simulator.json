{"q1":"What types of color blindness are simulated?","a1":"We simulate protanopia (red-blind), deuteranopia (green-blind), tritanopia (blue-yellow blind), and achromatopsia (total color blindness/monochromacy).","q2":"How accurate is the simulation?","a2":"The simulation uses standard color vision deficiency transformation matrices widely used in accessibility research. Results closely approximate the actual perception.","q3":"Why is this tool important for designers?","a3":"About 8% of men have some form of color blindness. Testing your color choices ensures your designs are accessible and usable by all users.","q4":"How many colors can I test?","a4":"You can test between 2 and 10 colors simultaneously, making it easy to check your entire design palette.","q5":"Is this tool free?","a5":"Yes, the Color Blindness Simulator is completely free with no usage limits."}
