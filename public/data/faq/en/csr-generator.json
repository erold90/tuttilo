{"q1":"Is it safe to generate keys in the browser?","a1":"Yes, the Web Crypto API uses cryptographically secure random number generation. Keys are generated entirely in your browser and never leave your device.","q2":"What key size should I choose?","a2":"RSA 2048-bit is sufficient for most use cases. RSA 4096-bit provides extra security. ECDSA P-256 offers equivalent security to RSA 3072 with smaller keys.","q3":"What format are the keys in?","a3":"Public keys are in SPKI (SubjectPublicKeyInfo) PEM format. Private keys are in PKCS#8 PEM format. Both are widely supported.","q4":"Can I use these keys for SSL certificates?","a4":"The public key can be used as part of a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) process, but generating a full CSR requires additional tools like OpenSSL."}
