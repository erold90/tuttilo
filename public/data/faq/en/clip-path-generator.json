The preview updates in real time as you make changes.","q4":"Is clip-path supported by all browsers?","a4":"Yes, clip-path with basic shapes is supported by all modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It is also hardware-accelerated for smooth rendering.","q5":"What is the inset shape?","a5":"Inset creates a rectangular clip with offsets from each edge (top, right, bottom, left) plus an optional border-radius.
