{"q1":"How are types inferred?","a1":"Strings become string, numbers become number, booleans become boolean. Objects generate new interfaces, arrays use element types.","q2":"Does it handle nested objects?","a2":"Yes, nested objects generate separate named interfaces with proper type references.","q3":"What about arrays of objects?","a3":"Arrays of objects generate a typed array using the first element to infer the interface structure."}
