{"q1":"Can I edit existing text in a PDF?","a1":"Yes. Click on any text in the PDF and the editor will detect the original font family, weight, and size. You can then modify the text and it will be rendered with a matching standard font at the same position.","q2":"What fonts are used for edited text?","a2":"The editor detects whether the original font is serif, sans-serif, or monospace, and whether it is bold or italic. It then uses the closest matching standard PDF font (Helvetica, Times, or Courier family) to redraw edited text.","q3":"Are my files safe?","a3":"Absolutely. All processing happens directly in your browser using pdf-lib and pdfjs-dist. Your PDF never leaves your device — nothing is uploaded to any server."}
