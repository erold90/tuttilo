{"q1":"Can I fill out any PDF form?","a1":"Yes, the tool detects all standard PDF form fields (text fields, checkboxes, dropdowns) automatically. If your PDF has interactive form fields, they will appear in the Fill Form tab for you to complete.","q2":"Is my signature legally valid?","a2":"This tool creates a visual signature (an image placed on the PDF). For most informal purposes and many business documents, this is sufficient. For legally binding electronic signatures that meet eIDAS or ESIGN standards, you may need a qualified digital signature service.","q3":"Are my files safe?","a3":"Absolutely. All processing happens directly in your browser. Your PDF and signature never leave your device — nothing is uploaded to any server."}
