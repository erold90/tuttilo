{"q1":"How does PDF repair work?","a1":"The tool uses a two-stage approach: first, it tries to parse and re-save the PDF directly. If that fails, it renders each page as a high-quality image and rebuilds a clean PDF.","q2":"Will I lose any content?","a2":"Stage 1 preserves all content including text and images. Stage 2 (image reconstruction) preserves visual appearance but text won't be selectable.","q3":"Are my files safe?","a3":"All processing happens in your browser. Your files never leave your device."}
