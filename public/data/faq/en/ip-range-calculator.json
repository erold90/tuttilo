{"q1":"How does CIDR range work?","a1":"CIDR notation (e.g., /24) defines the network prefix length. A /24 gives 256 IPs, /16 gives 65,536 IPs, etc.","q2":"What is the maximum range I can list?","a2":"The tool lists individual IPs for ranges up to /24 (256 addresses) to keep the browser responsive.","q3":"What is the first and last IP?","a3":"The first IP is the network address (all host bits 0) and the last IP is the broadcast address (all host bits 1).","q4":"Can I copy all IPs at once?","a4":"Yes, use the \"Copy all\" button to copy the entire IP list with one IP per line."}
