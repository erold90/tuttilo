{"q1":"How is password strength calculated?","a1":"Strength is calculated using entropy (bits of randomness), character diversity (4 types), length, and checks against common passwords and patterns.","q2":"Is my password sent to a server?","a2":"No. All analysis happens locally in your browser. Your password never leaves your device.","q3":"What makes a strong password?","a3":"A strong password is at least 12 characters long, uses uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols, and avoids common words or patterns.","q4":"What is password entropy?","a4":"Entropy measures randomness in bits. Higher entropy means more possible combinations, making the password harder to crack. 80+ bits is considered very strong.","q5":"Why does it flag common passwords?","a5":"Common passwords appear in breach databases and are the first ones attackers try. Even a long common password provides zero real security."}
