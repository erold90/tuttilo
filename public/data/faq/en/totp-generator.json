{"q1":"What is TOTP?","a1":"TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) is an algorithm that generates temporary codes using a shared secret and the current time. It is the standard behind Google Authenticator and similar apps.","q2":"Where do I find my secret key?","a2":"When setting up 2FA, the service provides a QR code or a Base32 secret key (like JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP). This is the key you enter here.","q3":"Is this compatible with Google Authenticator?","a3":"Yes. TOTP is a standard (RFC 6238). This tool generates the same codes as Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator, and others.","q4":"Is my secret key safe?","a4":"Yes. Everything runs locally in your browser. Your secret key is never stored or transmitted to any server.","q5":"Why is my code different from my authenticator app?","a5":"Ensure your device clock is accurate. TOTP codes depend on the current time. Even a few seconds of clock drift can produce different codes."}
