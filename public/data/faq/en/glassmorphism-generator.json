{"q1":"What is glassmorphism?","a1":"Glassmorphism is a UI design style that creates a frosted glass appearance using CSS backdrop-filter. Elements appear translucent with a blurred background, creating a sense of depth and layering.","q2":"Is backdrop-filter supported by all browsers?","a2":"Backdrop-filter is supported by all modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. The generator includes the -webkit- prefix for maximum compatibility. Older browsers will show a solid background.","q3":"How do I adjust the glass effect?","a3":"Use the blur slider to control how much background blur is visible. Opacity controls the glass transparency. Saturation boosts the colors seen through the glass. Border opacity adds a subtle edge.","q4":"Can I change the background?","a4":"Yes, use the two background color pickers to set the gradient behind the glass element. This lets you preview how the glass effect looks against different backgrounds.","q5":"What CSS properties does it use?","a5":"The effect uses background (with rgba for transparency), backdrop-filter (for blur and saturation), border (semi-transparent), and border-radius. All standard CSS properties."}
