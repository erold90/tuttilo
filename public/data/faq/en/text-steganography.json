{"q1":"What is text steganography?","a1":"Text steganography is the practice of hiding secret information within ordinary text so that only the intended recipient knows a hidden message exists.","q2":"How does zero-width steganography work?","a2":"It uses invisible Unicode characters (zero-width space, zero-width non-joiner) to encode binary data within normal text. These characters are invisible but preserved when text is copied.","q3":"Can the hidden message be detected?","a3":"Yes, by someone who knows to look for zero-width characters. This is not encryption - it is concealment. For security, encrypt your message before hiding it.","q4":"Does it work with all text formats?","a4":"It works with any system that preserves Unicode characters, including most messaging apps, emails, and text editors. Some platforms may strip zero-width characters."}
