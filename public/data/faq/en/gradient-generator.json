{"q1":"What types of CSS gradients can I create?","a1":"You can create three types: linear gradients (with custom angle), radial gradients (circle shape), and conic gradients (rotating color sweep). Each type supports multiple color stops with adjustable positions.","q2":"How do I add more colors to my gradient?","a2":"Click the \"Add Stop\" button to add a new color stop. Each stop has a color picker, hex input, and position slider. You can add as many stops as you need and remove any stop (minimum 2 required).","q3":"Can I copy the generated CSS code?","a3":"Yes, the tool generates ready-to-use CSS code that you can copy to your clipboard with one click. The code uses the standard CSS gradient syntax supported by all modern browsers.","q4":"Does this tool work offline?","a4":"Yes, the gradient generator runs entirely in your browser. No internet connection is needed after the page loads, and no data is sent to any server.","q5":"What is a conic gradient?","a5":"A conic gradient creates color transitions rotated around a center point, like a color wheel. It is useful for creating pie-chart-like effects, loading spinners, and other circular color patterns."}
