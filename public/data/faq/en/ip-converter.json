{"q1":"What IP formats are supported?","a1":"Dotted decimal (192.168.1.1), decimal integer, hexadecimal (0x prefix), and binary (with or without dots).","q2":"What is an IPv6-mapped address?","a2":"An IPv6-mapped address (::ffff:x.x.x.x) represents an IPv4 address in IPv6 format for dual-stack systems.","q3":"How is IP converted to decimal?","a3":"Each octet is treated as a byte, combined into a 32-bit unsigned integer. For example, 192.168.1.1 = 192*256^3 + 168*256^2 + 1*256 + 1.","q4":"Can I input binary IP addresses?","a4":"Yes, enter binary with or without dots separating octets (e.g., 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001)."}
