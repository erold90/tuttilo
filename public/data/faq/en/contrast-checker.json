{"q1":"What is WCAG contrast ratio?","a1":"WCAG contrast ratio measures the relative luminance between foreground and background colors, on a scale from 1:1 (no contrast) to 21:1 (maximum contrast, black on white). Higher ratios mean better readability.","q2":"What are the WCAG AA and AAA requirements?","a2":"WCAG AA requires a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text (18px+ bold or 24px+). WCAG AAA is stricter, requiring 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.","q3":"Why does color contrast matter for accessibility?","a3":"Many people have visual impairments including low vision, color blindness, or age-related vision loss. Sufficient contrast ensures that text content is readable by the widest possible audience, which is both a usability best practice and often a legal requirement.","q4":"How do I fix a failing contrast ratio?","a4":"Make the foreground darker or the background lighter (or vice versa). You can use our tool to experiment with different color combinations until you find one that passes the required WCAG level while maintaining your design aesthetics.","q5":"Does this tool support alpha transparency?","a5":"The current version works with opaque (solid) HEX colors. For transparent colors, the effective contrast depends on underlying layers. Test with the final rendered color for accurate results."}
