{"q1":"How is transfer time calculated?","a1":"Transfer time = (file size in bits) / (connection speed in bits per second). We convert all units to bits for accurate calculation.","q2":"What is the difference between Mbps and MB/s?","a2":"Mbps (megabits per second) measures network speed, while MB/s (megabytes per second) measures data throughput. 1 MB/s = 8 Mbps.","q3":"Does this account for overhead?","a3":"This calculator gives theoretical transfer time. Real-world transfers include protocol overhead, so actual times may be 5-15% longer.","q4":"What speed should I use for WiFi?","a4":"Typical WiFi speeds range from 50-200 Mbps for WiFi 5 (802.11ac) and 200-1000 Mbps for WiFi 6 (802.11ax)."}
