{"q1":"What is a SERP?","a1":"SERP stands for Search Engine Results Page.

Titles longer than this may be truncated with an ellipsis in search results.","q3":"Why does my search snippet look different than expected?","a3":"Google may rewrite your title tag or meta description if it determines a different snippet would be more relevant to the search query. Writing clear, relevant meta tags reduces this likelihood."}
