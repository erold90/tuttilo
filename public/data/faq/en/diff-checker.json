{"q1":"How does the diff checker work?","a1":"Paste your original and modified text in the two input areas. The tool uses a Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm to find and highlight all differences.","q2":"Can I compare code files?","a2":"Yes! The diff checker works with any text including source code, configuration files, and documents. It preserves formatting and uses monospace font for code.","q3":"Is there a size limit?","a3":"The tool runs entirely in your browser, so there is no upload limit. However very large texts (100K+ lines) may be slow."}
