The tool analyzes PDF content and reconstructs it as native Word elements rather than embedded images, allowing you to modify text, adjust formatting, and reflow content. Converting in the opposite direction creates PDFs from Word files while maintaining fonts, styles, and page structure. The bidirectional conversion runs entirely within your browser using client-side processing libraries, ensuring documents containing proprietary information or confidential data never leave your computer.","p3":"Freelance writers convert client-provided PDF briefs into Word documents to add tracked changes and editorial comments during the revision process. HR managers transform PDF job descriptions into editable templates for creating new position postings with updated requirements. Consultants convert proposal PDFs received from partners into Word format to merge sections and customize content for specific clients. Academic administrators turn PDF course syllabi into editable Word files for faculty to update semester schedules and reading lists. Small business owners convert vendor contracts from PDF to Word to mark up terms before sending to legal review.","p4":"PDF-to-Word conversion works best with text-based documents rather than scanned images, which require OCR processing separately. Complex layouts with multiple columns, text boxes, or intricate graphics may require manual formatting adjustments after conversion. Before converting important documents, check that all special characters and symbols transferred correctly, particularly mathematical notation or foreign language text. When creating PDFs from Word, use high-quality settings if the document contains detailed charts or diagrams. Save converted files under new names to preserve the original in case you need to reference the source formatting."},"pdf-editor":{"p2":"Load your PDF and click anywhere on the page to insert new text with automatic font and size matching to blend seamlessly with existing content. The tool detects fonts already used in the document and attempts to replicate them, though complex or proprietary fonts fall back to standard alternatives. Beyond text editing, you can draw freehand annotations, highlight passages, and add shapes or arrows for visual markup. All editing operations modify a copy of your document locally in the browser, leaving the original file unchanged on your device until you explicitly download the edited version.","p3":"Property managers fill in tenant information on standardized lease agreement templates without printing and rescanning. Educators annotate student essay PDFs with margin comments and correction marks before returning graded assignments. Construction supervisors markup architectural plans with revision notes and measurement corrections for contractor teams. Medical office staff add patient appointment details and insurance codes to blank intake form templates. Event planners edit venue contract PDFs to insert specific dates, attendee counts, and customized catering requirements before submitting to suppliers.","p4":"For best font matching, stick to common typefaces like Arial, Helvetica, or Times New Roman that are universally available across systems. When adding substantial new text, check that line spacing and alignment match surrounding content to avoid obvious visual inconsistencies. Use the drawing tools sparingly on text-heavy documents to prevent obscuring important information—lighter colors and thinner lines work better for annotations. If font matching fails, consider replacing entire text blocks rather than mixing mismatched fonts within paragraphs. Always preview the final page before downloading to catch alignment issues or text overflow that may not be obvious during editing."},"pdf-fill-sign":{"p2":"Click on any form field to type responses directly into text boxes, checkboxes, and dropdown menus without printing the document. The signature feature lets you draw your signature using a mouse or trackpad, type your name in script font, or upload an image of your handwritten signature saved from a previous signing. Position signatures and initials precisely where required by dragging them to the appropriate lines. Since form filling and signing happen entirely in your browser, sensitive information like social security numbers, bank account details, or medical data never gets transmitted to external servers during the process.","p3":"Remote employees sign employment contracts, non-disclosure agreements, and direct deposit authorization forms for new jobs without printing or mailing physical paperwork. Parents complete school permission slips, emergency contact forms, and field trip waivers electronically before deadlines. Loan applicants fill out mortgage pre-qualification forms and sign disclosure documents from home instead of visiting bank branches. Medical patients complete intake questionnaires and HIPAA consent forms before telehealth appointments. Freelancers sign client service agreements and project proposals while negotiating terms via email, eliminating delays from postal delivery.","p4":"Create a reusable signature image once and save it separately for quick insertion into future documents rather than redrawing each time. Before signing important contracts, read the entire document carefully—the convenience of digital signing shouldn't rush critical decisions. For forms with many fields, tab through entries systematically to avoid skipping required information that could invalidate the submission. If a signature looks pixelated or unclear after placement, redraw it at a larger size before shrinking to fit the signature line. Save a copy of the completed form before submitting it to maintain your own records of what was signed and when."},"pdf-images":{"p2":"Converting PDFs to images extracts each page as a separate high-resolution JPG or PNG file, useful for sharing specific pages on social media or embedding in presentations. Going the other direction, you can select multiple image files to combine them into a single multi-page PDF with each photo appearing on its own page. Choose output quality and resolution settings to balance file size against image clarity based on your intended use. The bidirectional conversion happens entirely in your browser, so vacation photos, design mockups, or business graphics remain private throughout the transformation process.","p3":"Graphic designers convert finished PDF mockups into PNG images with transparent backgrounds for client presentations and portfolio websites. Social media managers extract infographic pages from multi-page PDF reports to share as individual Instagram posts or Twitter cards. E-commerce sellers combine product photos into PDF catalogs for wholesale buyers to download complete collections. Real estate photographers merge property images into PDF showing packages for listing agents to share with potential buyers. Students convert lecture slide PDFs into individual images to insert specific diagrams into research papers and study guides.","p4":"Use PNG output format when you need transparent backgrounds or sharp text clarity, while JPG works better for photographs where smaller file sizes matter more than perfect quality. When creating PDFs from images, arrange files in the correct order before conversion since reordering afterward requires additional tools. For scanned documents being converted to PDF, ensure consistent image orientation beforehand to avoid mixed portrait and landscape pages. If converting PDFs with complex graphics or gradients to images, choose higher DPI settings to prevent visible pixelation in the output. Consider compression settings carefully when batch converting multiple pages—very high quality can produce unwieldy file sizes."},"pdf-excel":{"p2":"Upload a PDF containing tables and the tool analyzes page layout to identify columnar data, reconstructing it as native Excel cells with preserved row and column alignment. Text-based PDFs with clear table structures convert most reliably, while scanned documents may require OCR processing first for accurate data extraction. Converting from Excel to PDF transforms spreadsheets into fixed-layout documents that display consistently across devices, maintaining formulas as calculated values and preserving cell formatting. All conversion processing runs locally in your browser, keeping financial statements, sales reports, and budget spreadsheets private on your device.","p3":"Financial analysts convert quarterly earnings report PDFs from public companies into Excel format to build comparison models and perform ratio analysis. Small business owners transform scanned receipt images into Excel expense logs for bookkeeping and tax preparation. Marketing teams convert campaign performance PDFs from advertising platforms into editable spreadsheets for custom chart creation. Supply chain managers extract inventory data tables from vendor PDF catalogs into Excel for sorting, filtering, and reorder calculations. Researchers convert statistical tables from published journal article PDFs into Excel datasets for meta-analysis and replication studies.","p4":"Table detection works best when PDF data is organized in clear rows and columns with consistent spacing—merged cells and complex nested structures may require manual cleanup after conversion. Before converting important financial data, verify that numbers transferred correctly and formulas didn't get lost, especially for percentages and currency formats. When creating PDFs from Excel, freeze header rows and adjust page breaks beforehand to ensure tables don't split awkwardly across pages. If a PDF contains multiple separate tables, consider extracting them into individual Excel sheets rather than one combined worksheet. Test converted files by spot-checking several data points against the original to catch any extraction errors early."},"pdf-pptx":{"p2":"Load a PDF to convert each page into an individual PowerPoint slide, allowing you to extract presentation content for editing and customization. The tool attempts to preserve text, images, and layout positioning, though complex PDF designs may require adjustment in PowerPoint after conversion. Going the reverse direction, PPTX files become fixed-layout PDFs suitable for distribution when you want to prevent recipients from altering slides or when presenting on systems without PowerPoint installed. All conversion happens in your browser using client-side processing, so proprietary business presentations and confidential pitch decks never upload to external servers.","p3":"Sales teams convert competitor pitch decks received as PDFs into editable PowerPoint format to analyze messaging strategies and visual approaches. Conference speakers transform submitted PDF presentation files into PPTX to add custom branding and speaker notes before delivering talks. Training coordinators convert educational PDF modules into PowerPoint to incorporate interactive quizzes and discussion prompts for live workshops. Marketing agencies transform client-provided PDF brand guidelines into PowerPoint templates for creating consistent promotional materials. Consultants convert proposal PDFs from one client into reusable PowerPoint slide libraries for customizing future pitches to similar industries.","p4":"PDF-to-PowerPoint conversion works most reliably on presentations originally created in slide software rather than complex multi-column documents designed for printing. After conversion, check that images maintained proper resolution and alignment, especially logos and charts that need to stay pixel-perfect. When creating PDFs from PowerPoint, use high-quality export settings if slides contain detailed diagrams or photographs that will be viewed on large displays. Embedded videos and animations won't transfer during conversion—note their positions and re-add them manually if needed. If you're converting to modify a few slides, consider editing just those pages as images rather than converting the entire presentation."},"html-to-pdf":{"p2":"Paste HTML code directly into the editor and the tool renders it as a visual page before converting to PDF format. CSS styling and basic layout elements are preserved, allowing you to transform web content, email templates, or code snippets into shareable documents. This is particularly useful for archiving web pages, creating printable versions of online content, or generating reports from HTML-formatted data. The conversion processes entirely in your browser, so HTML containing proprietary information or embedded sensitive data never leaves your computer during PDF generation.","p3":"Web developers convert HTML email templates into PDF mockups for client approval before coding final responsive versions. Bloggers archive important web articles as PDFs to preserve formatting and content that might change or disappear from original sources. Data analysts convert HTML reports generated by analytics scripts into PDF format for distribution to stakeholders who prefer static documents. Legal teams save HTML-formatted contract drafts as PDFs to create timestamped records of agreement versions during negotiation. Teachers convert interactive HTML tutorials into printable PDF study guides for students without reliable internet access.","p4":"Keep HTML relatively simple for best conversion results—complex JavaScript, external stylesheets, and intricate CSS frameworks may not render perfectly in the PDF output. Inline CSS styles directly in your HTML rather than linking external files to ensure formatting transfers correctly. Test that images referenced in your HTML are accessible; broken image links will appear as placeholders in the final PDF. For multi-page content, use explicit page break CSS properties to control where pages divide rather than letting the converter decide automatically. If your HTML contains interactive elements like forms or buttons, remember these won't function in the static PDF—consider removing or replacing them with equivalent static content first."},"unlock-pdf":{"p2":"Upload a password-protected PDF and if you have the correct password, the tool removes restrictions that prevent printing, copying, or editing. Some PDFs have user passwords (required to open the file) while others have owner passwords (that restrict permissions)—this tool handles both types when credentials are provided. The unlocking process strips security metadata and creates an unrestricted copy of the document. All processing occurs locally in your browser, so documents containing confidential information remain on your device and passwords aren't transmitted to any server during the unlock operation.","p3":"Remote workers unlock company PDF documents received with outdated passwords to enable copying text for reports after the original document creator left the organization. Researchers remove printing restrictions from archived journal articles to create physical reference copies for offline study. Legal assistants unlock case file PDFs to enable text selection and copying when extracting quotes for briefs and motions. Small business owners remove editing restrictions from vendor-supplied PDF forms to customize fields and branding for their specific operations. Archivists unlock historical PDF documents where original passwords are documented in institutional records but restrictions prevent digital preservation workflows.","p4":"This tool only removes restrictions from PDFs where you already have access—it cannot crack or bypass unknown passwords, which would violate security protections. If you frequently receive protected documents from the same source, request unrestricted versions to avoid repetitive unlocking. Before unlocking documents for editing, verify you have legal authority to modify them since some restrictions are intentionally placed to prevent unauthorized changes. Save unlocked versions under clearly labeled filenames to distinguish them from the original protected copies. Remember that removing protection doesn't enhance document quality or repair corrupted files—it only eliminates access restrictions."},"pdf-protect":{"p2":"Set a user password to require authentication before anyone can open your PDF, preventing unauthorized viewing of confidential content. Configure owner password controls to restrict specific actions like printing, copying text, editing pages, or form filling even after the document is opened. The tool encrypts your PDF and embeds permission flags recognized by PDF readers, enforcing restrictions on compliant software. All password protection and encryption happens locally in your browser, ensuring sensitive documents and passwords never transmit to external servers during the security process.","p3":"Law firms protect client case documents with passwords before sharing via email to ensure only intended recipients can view privileged communications. HR departments restrict copying and editing on employee handbook PDFs to prevent unauthorized modifications to company policies. Financial advisors password-protect retirement planning documents sent to clients containing social security numbers and account details. Consultants protect proprietary methodology guides and strategic reports to prevent clients from redistributing intellectual property. Healthcare providers restrict printing on patient medical record PDFs to maintain HIPAA compliance when sharing via secure portals.","p4":"Use strong, unique passwords combining letters, numbers, and symbols rather than simple phrases that are easy to guess or crack. Document your passwords securely in a password manager—losing the password to an important encrypted PDF can make data permanently inaccessible. Consider whether you need user password protection (prevents opening) or just permission restrictions (allows viewing but limits actions) based on your security requirements. Test protected PDFs on different PDF readers to verify restrictions work as expected, since enforcement varies across software. If sharing password-protected files, communicate passwords through a separate channel from the document itself to maintain security if one channel is compromised."},"pdf-flatten":{"p2":"Flattening converts all interactive form fields, annotations, and comments into static page content that becomes part of the permanent document image. After flattening, text previously entered in fillable fields can no longer be edited, dropdown selections become fixed text, and annotation layers merge into the background. This process is irreversible, so the tool creates a new flattened copy while preserving your original file. All flattening happens in your browser, keeping documents containing completed personal information or business data private on your device throughout the transformation.","p3":"Government agencies flatten completed application forms before archiving to prevent accidental data modification in official records. Legal departments flatten signed contracts after execution to ensure terms cannot be altered during storage and future reference. HR teams flatten completed employee onboarding forms to create permanent personnel file records that prevent subsequent editing. Financial institutions flatten loan applications containing customer signatures to maintain unalterable records for compliance audits. Educational administrators flatten student enrollment forms with parent signatures to preserve official registration documentation that cannot be tampered with.","p4":"Always verify that all required fields are completed correctly before flattening, since you cannot edit form data afterward without recreating the entire document. Flatten documents after collecting final signatures but before long-term archiving to prevent format compatibility issues with future PDF software versions. If you need to maintain an editable version for updates, save the original separately before flattening and clearly label which file is the permanent record. Flattening also locks down annotations and comments, so ensure all reviewer feedback has been addressed before making changes permanent. Check that flattened documents display correctly across different PDF viewers, as some complex form elements may render slightly differently after merging into page content."},"pdf-crop":{"p2":"Adjust margin sliders to trim white space or remove unwanted borders from all pages simultaneously, creating a more compact document with larger content relative to page size. The visual preview shows exactly what area will be retained, letting you fine-tune crop boundaries before applying changes. This is especially useful for PDFs that were scanned with excessive margins or documents where binding margins need removal for digital distribution. All cropping calculations happen in your browser, keeping documents containing sensitive diagrams or proprietary content private on your device during the margin adjustment process.","p3":"Architects crop construction drawings to remove title block margins when sending detail views to subcontractors who only need specific sections. Students trim scanned textbook pages to eliminate page numbers and headers, maximizing content size for tablet reading. Graphic designers crop presentation PDFs to remove placeholder margins added during template creation. Researchers crop journal article scans to eliminate library watermarks and binding margins for cleaner personal reference files. Publishers crop submitted manuscript PDFs to remove author contact information and metadata before sending to anonymous peer reviewers.","p4":"Preview the crop on several representative pages before applying to ensure you're not accidentally trimming important content from pages with varying layouts. For documents with intentional margin differences across pages (like wider binding edges), cropping uniformly may cut off content on some pages while leaving excess margin on others. If you need to crop different pages differently, consider splitting the PDF first, cropping sections separately, then merging them back together. Leave slightly more margin than the minimum to account for printer tolerances if the cropped PDF will eventually be printed. Check that page numbers, footnotes, or headers aren't positioned in margins you're removing—they'll disappear after cropping."},"pdf-compare":{"p2":"Upload two versions of the same document and the tool displays them side by side with synchronized scrolling for visual inspection. A difference analysis runs pixel-level comparison to identify modified text, added content, deleted sections, and formatting changes between versions. The tool calculates an overall difference percentage and highlights changed areas, making it easy to spot revisions quickly. All comparison processing happens locally in your browser, so confidential contract drafts or proprietary document versions never leave your device during the analysis.","p3":"Legal teams compare contract draft versions to verify all requested changes were implemented before client signing. Quality assurance reviewers compare training manual revisions to ensure updated procedures replaced outdated instructions correctly. Compliance officers compare policy document versions to identify what changed between annual reviews for change log documentation. Editors compare manuscript draft iterations to confirm author revisions addressed all editorial feedback. Financial auditors compare report versions to trace when and where discrepancies were introduced during document preparation.","p4":"For most accurate comparison, ensure both PDFs are the same page size and orientation—misaligned pages will show false differences even if content is identical. Text-based PDFs compare more reliably than scanned images where slight scan variations can trigger false positive differences. When reviewing comparison results, focus on meaningful content changes rather than minor rendering differences in fonts or spacing. If the tool reports high difference percentages for supposedly similar documents, check that you're comparing the right versions—completely different files will show near 100% difference. Use this tool to verify changes rather than identify what specifically changed; for detailed text diffs, consider converting to Word and using track changes."},"pdf-page-numbers":{"p2":"Select where you want page numbers to appear (top or bottom, left, center, or right) and configure the starting number and format style. The tool adds numbers to all pages consistently, using a font size and style that complements your document. You can exclude the first page if it's a cover sheet or begin numbering from a specific page in the middle of the document. All page numbering happens in your browser, keeping documents containing proprietary information or confidential content private on your device during the numbering process.","p3":"Students add page numbers to thesis drafts to meet university formatting requirements before final submission. Lawyers number exhibit pages in case filings to comply with court document formatting rules. Technical writers add page numbers to user manuals so support teams can reference specific pages during customer troubleshooting calls. Event planners number conference program PDFs to help attendees navigate session schedules and venue maps. HR departments add page numbers to employee handbooks to facilitate easier reference during policy discussions and training sessions.","p4":"Check existing page numbers before adding new ones to avoid creating duplicates if some pages already have numbering. For documents that will be printed and bound, position numbers with sufficient margin clearance to prevent trimming during the binding process. If your document has distinct sections requiring different numbering styles (like Roman numerals for front matter), consider splitting the PDF, numbering sections separately, then merging them back together. Choose font sizes large enough to be legible but not so prominent that they distract from page content. Preview several pages across the document before finalizing to ensure consistent placement, especially if pages have varying content layouts."},"pdf-watermark":{"p2":"Type your watermark text and adjust font size, opacity, rotation angle, and positioning to create either subtle branding or prominent copyright protection. The watermark applies to all pages simultaneously with consistent placement and styling. You can make watermarks nearly transparent for background branding or highly opaque to prevent unauthorized use of documents. All watermarking happens locally in your browser, keeping proprietary presentations and confidential reports private on your device while adding protection layers.","p3":"Photographers watermark portfolio PDFs with copyright notices before sending work samples to potential clients to discourage unauthorized use. Consultants add \"Confidential Draft\" watermarks to proposal versions shared during client review to prevent premature external distribution. Real estate agencies watermark property listing PDFs with agency branding to maintain attribution when agents share materials with buyers. Academic researchers watermark preprint PDFs with \"Not for Distribution\" labels before circulating to peer reviewers. Law firms watermark discovery document PDFs with case numbers and confidentiality designations for organized case management.","p4":"Set watermark opacity between 20-40% for subtle background branding that doesn't interfere with document readability, or use 80-100% for prominent protection on sensitive materials. Diagonal watermarks across page centers are harder to crop out than those placed in corners. Test watermark visibility on both screen and printed versions since opacity appears differently in each medium. For copyright protection, include the copyright symbol, year, and rights holder name rather than just generic \"Confidential\" text. Avoid placing watermarks over critical content areas like charts, tables, or signature lines where they might obscure important information."},"pdf-ocr":{"p2":"Upload scanned PDFs or image-based documents and the tool applies optical character recognition to detect and extract text from the visual content. Tesseract.js technology analyzes each page, identifies text regions, recognizes individual characters, and converts the image into searchable, copyable text. You can select from eight supported languages to improve recognition accuracy for non-English documents. All OCR processing runs entirely in your browser using client-side machine learning models, ensuring scanned contracts, receipts, and personal documents never upload to external servers.","p3":"Accountants extract text from scanned invoice images to copy vendor information and amounts into bookkeeping software without manual retyping. Researchers convert scanned pages from old library books into searchable text for quoting in academic papers. Legal assistants extract text from court filing image PDFs to search for specific case references and dates. Students convert photographed lecture notes into typed text for organizing digital study guides. Genealogists extract names and dates from scanned historical document images for family tree databases.","p4":"OCR accuracy improves significantly with high-contrast scans—ensure original documents are clearly legible before scanning for best text recognition results. Select the correct language setting to match your document's content, as character recognition algorithms are trained on specific language patterns. Clean scans with minimal skew and distortion work better than photos taken at angles or with shadows. Always proofread OCR output carefully, especially for numbers, dates, and proper nouns where recognition errors are common. For multi-page documents, process a single test page first to verify language settings and quality before committing to processing the entire file."},"pdf-repair":{"p2":"Upload corrupted PDFs that won't open in standard readers and the tool attempts two-stage recovery using pdf-lib and pdfjs-dist libraries. First, it tries to reconstruct the document structure and fix header corruption. If that fails, it attempts deeper recovery by extracting intact page content and rebuilding the file from recoverable elements. The success rate depends on the type and extent of corruption—complete recovery isn't always possible for severely damaged files. All repair attempts process locally in your browser, keeping potentially corrupted documents containing sensitive information private on your device.","p3":"IT professionals recover project documentation PDFs corrupted during failed disk recovery operations. Students repair thesis drafts damaged when systems crashed during saving. Archivists attempt to recover historical PDF documents degraded by bit rot on aging storage media. Legal teams recover corrupted case file PDFs before critical filing deadlines when backups aren't available. Finance departments repair damaged invoice PDFs received from vendors with transmission errors or storage issues.","p4":"Always keep original corrupted files until you verify repaired versions are complete and usable—the repair process might recover partial content but lose some pages or formatting. If initial repair fails, try converting the corrupted PDF to images first using a different tool, which might preserve visual content even if structural repair isn't possible. For important documents, consider professional data recovery services if automated repair fails, especially for legal records or irreplaceable archives. Regular backups prevent corruption disasters—this tool should be a last resort rather than a substitute for proper file management. Check that all pages, images, and formatting survived the repair process before discarding the corrupted original."},"pdf-to-pdfa":{"p2":"Upload any standard PDF and the tool converts it to PDF/A-1b format, an ISO-standardized archival variant designed for long-term preservation. The conversion embeds all fonts, images, and content directly into the file, removes external dependencies, and adds conformance metadata that archival systems recognize. PDF/A files are self-contained and don't rely on external resources that might become unavailable over time. All conversion happens in your browser, keeping archival documents containing historical records or proprietary information private on your device during the standardization process.","p3":"Corporate archivists convert business records to PDF/A format to comply with document retention regulations requiring specific preservation standards. Legal departments convert executed contracts to PDF/A for long-term storage in compliance with statute-of-limitations requirements. Government agencies convert public records to PDF/A before submitting to national archives for permanent preservation. Healthcare organizations convert patient medical records to PDF/A to meet HIPAA-compliant archival storage standards. University libraries convert digitized rare manuscripts to PDF/A format to ensure accessibility decades into the future as technology evolves.","p4":"PDF/A files are larger than standard PDFs because all fonts and resources are embedded—expect size increases of 10-30% depending on original file complexity. Some advanced PDF features like JavaScript, encryption, and multimedia don't transfer to PDF/A since they're not allowed in the archival standard. Verify converted files meet your organization's specific PDF/A compliance requirements, as variations like PDF/A-2 and PDF/A-3 have different feature sets. Use PDF/A for final archival versions rather than working documents, since the format prioritizes preservation over editability. Test that archived files open correctly in PDF/A validators to confirm conformance before committing to long-term storage."},"pdf-to-text":{"p2":"Upload a PDF and the tool extracts all text content from every page, preserving paragraph breaks but removing formatting like bold, italics, and fonts. The resulting plain text can be copied directly to your clipboard or downloaded as a TXT file for use in word processors, databases, or note-taking applications. This works best with text-based PDFs rather than scanned images, which require OCR processing first. All text extraction happens in your browser, ensuring documents containing confidential information remain private on your device during the conversion process.","p3":"Content writers extract text from PDF research materials to create quote compilations and reference notes for article drafting. Data analysts extract tables and figures from PDF reports to reformat into CSV files for database import. Students copy PDF lecture notes into study guide documents where they can add highlights and annotations. Translators extract source text from PDF documents to paste into translation software for language conversion. Developers extract configuration data or code snippets embedded in PDF technical documentation for copying into development environments.","p4":"Extracted text loses all original formatting including headings, lists, tables, and columns—what you get is a linear text stream requiring reformatting for most uses. For PDFs with complex multi-column layouts, extracted text may appear scrambled since the tool reads left-to-right without understanding column structure. Check that special characters, symbols, and non-English text transferred correctly, as some fonts may not extract properly. If you need to preserve formatting, consider PDF-to-Word conversion instead of plain text extraction. Use this tool when you only care about content, not presentation—it's ideal for feeding text into analysis tools or creating searchable archives."},"pdf-metadata":{"p2":"Upload a PDF to view embedded metadata including document title, author name, subject description, keyword tags, creation date, modification date, page count, and file size. This information is stored in the PDF header and provides context about document origin, versioning, and content. Metadata viewing is read-only—this tool displays information without modifying the file. All metadata reading happens locally in your browser, so PDFs containing proprietary information remain on your device while you inspect their properties.","p3":"Digital forensics investigators examine PDF metadata to determine when documents were created and modified during litigation discovery. Archivists check creation dates on historical document scans to organize chronological digital collections. Publishers verify author attribution and copyright dates in submitted manuscript PDFs before publication. IT security teams inspect metadata to detect potentially forged documents with suspicious creation dates or missing author information. Researchers track version history by comparing modification dates across multiple PDF drafts during collaborative writing projects.","p4":"Metadata can be incomplete or inaccurate if files were created by converters that don't populate fields properly—absence of metadata doesn't necessarily indicate tampering. Author names often reflect the computer account or PDF software license rather than the actual document creator. Creation and modification dates can be manipulated or reset during file conversion, so don't rely solely on timestamps for authentication. Some PDF generators strip metadata entirely for privacy reasons, resulting in blank or minimal information fields. If you need to edit or remove metadata for privacy before sharing files, use a dedicated metadata removal tool rather than manual editing."},"grayscale-pdf":{"p2":"Upload a color PDF and the tool converts all page content to grayscale by removing color information from images, graphics, and text. The conversion preserves document layout, fonts, and structure while transforming the color space from RGB/CMYK to grayscale values. This reduces file size and prepares documents for black-and-white printing where color would waste toner. All grayscale conversion happens locally in your browser, keeping documents containing confidential information or proprietary designs private on your device during color removal.","p3":"Students convert color textbook PDFs to grayscale before printing to avoid expensive color printing fees at campus print centers. Small businesses convert marketing materials to black-and-white for cost-effective mass printing of internal training guides. Archivists convert historical document scans to grayscale when color provides no additional informational value. Researchers prepare journal article manuscript PDFs in grayscale to comply with publisher submission requirements. Environmental groups convert color documents to grayscale to reduce printer toner consumption and extend cartridge life.","p4":"Test critical diagrams and charts after conversion to ensure important distinctions originally shown in color remain clear in grayscale—some color-coded information may become ambiguous. Grayscale conversion typically reduces file size by 30-50% for image-heavy documents since grayscale data requires less storage than full color. If your PDF contains critical color-coded content like maps or data visualizations, consider whether grayscale conversion will make the document less useful. The tool doesn't enhance contrast or adjust brightness—if scanned originals are faded, convert to grayscale first won't improve legibility.
