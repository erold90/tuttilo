{"p2":"Select your desired algorithm: RSA with 2048 or 4096-bit key size, or ECDSA with the P-256 elliptic curve. Click generate, and the tool creates a cryptographic key pair using your browser's Web Crypto API. The private key and public key are both displayed in PEM format, ready to copy or download. Private keys are generated using cryptographically secure random number generation. For RSA, the public exponent is 65537. For ECDSA, the NIST P-256 curve provides equivalent security to 3072-bit RSA. Store your private key securely—it never leaves your browser during generation.","p3":"Developers create key pairs for testing SSL/TLS implementations without exposing production keys. System administrators generate new keys for web servers, VPNs, or SSH access. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts experiment with public-key cryptography concepts. Security students learn about asymmetric encryption by generating and examining real key pairs. IoT developers create device-specific keys for mutual TLS authentication. Certificate authorities generate intermediate signing keys in air-gapped environments for maximum security.","p4":"Never generate production keys on a shared or untrusted computer—use a secure, offline machine for critical keys. RSA 4096-bit keys provide better future security but are slower for operations than 2048-bit keys; choose based on your security vs. performance needs. ECDSA keys are much smaller than equivalent RSA keys and faster to generate, making them ideal for IoT and mobile applications. Always store private keys encrypted at rest using strong passwords. For SSH, you'll need to convert the PEM format to OpenSSH format using ssh-keygen. Public keys can be freely shared, but treat private keys like passwords—never commit them to version control."}
