{"p2":"Specify your desired image dimensions in pixels using the width and height inputs. Select background and text colors using the color pickers to match your design mockup's color scheme. Add optional custom text that will display centered on the placeholder, or leave it to show dimensions by default. Click generate to create your placeholder image instantly in the browser canvas. Download the resulting PNG file for use in wireframes, prototypes, or development environments. All image generation runs client-side in Tuttilo with no server processing or external image services.","p3":"Web developers build responsive layouts using placeholder images at various breakpoints before final photography is available. UI designers create high-fidelity mockups with dimension-specific placeholders that clearly communicate image slot requirements to developers. Content managers draft blog post layouts using placeholders to visualize article flow before commissioning custom graphics. Marketing teams prototype landing page concepts with sized placeholders that show where hero images and product photos will eventually appear.","p4":"Generate placeholders at exact aspect ratios you'll use in production to catch layout issues during development rather than after final images arrive. Use distinct background colors for different image types in your mockup—blue for headers, gray for thumbnails—to improve visual hierarchy during reviews. Include dimension text in your placeholders during development, then regenerate without text when presenting to clients or stakeholders. Save frequently used dimension combinations as files to speed up future projects with similar layouts. Remember to replace all placeholders before production deployment—leaving gray boxes in live sites is unprofessional."}
