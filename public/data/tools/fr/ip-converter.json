{"p2":"Paste or type an IPv4 address in any supported format: dotted decimal (192.168.1.1), hexadecimal (0xC0A80101), binary (11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001), or 32-bit decimal integer (3232235777). The tool automatically detects the input format and instantly converts it to all other representations. Each conversion is computed using JavaScript bitwise operations with full accuracy. The interface displays all four formats simultaneously, making it easy to copy the representation you need. This is particularly useful when working with network programming, security analysis, or low-level protocol implementation.","p3":"Security researchers convert IP addresses found in hexadecimal format within packet captures or binary logs. Network programmers work with IP addresses stored as 32-bit integers in databases or binary file formats. Reverse engineers analyze network protocols that encode IPs in non-standard formats. System administrators decode IP addresses from memory dumps or raw network traffic. Malware analysts investigate obfuscated IP addresses that attackers encode to evade detection. Developers test IP parsing functions by generating test cases in multiple formats.","p4":"When debugging network code, hexadecimal format makes it easier to spot byte-order (endianness) issues in raw socket programming. Binary representation helps visualize subnet boundaries and understand how subnet masks work at the bit level. The 32-bit integer format is most efficient for database storage and numerical comparisons. For security analysis, be aware that attackers sometimes obfuscate IPs using decimal or hex notation to bypass simple string-based filters. When copying values, verify the format matches what your target system expects—some tools are strict about dotted decimal versus integer representation."}
