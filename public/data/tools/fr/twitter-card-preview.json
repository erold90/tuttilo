{"p2":"Fill in your content's title, description, image URL, and choose between summary or summary with large image card types. The preview renders exactly how your link will appear when shared on Twitter (X), showing character truncation and image dimensions in real-time. The tool generates the complete set of Twitter Card meta tags needed in your HTML head section. All rendering happens in Tuttilo's browser environment without sending data to external servers. Copy the generated tags and verify your implementation using Twitter's Card Validator tool after deployment.","p3":"Marketing teams launching campaigns ensure tweet links display compelling previews that drive traffic to landing pages. Content creators sharing blog posts optimize headlines and images specifically for Twitter's visual format to maximize engagement. Product launches benefit from large image cards that showcase new features prominently in users' timelines. News organizations control how breaking stories appear when journalists share articles, maintaining brand consistency across social media.","p4":"Use summary_large_image card type for content where the visual is the primary draw, and standard summary for text-focused articles where the headline matters more. Your image should be at least 300x157 pixels for summary cards or 800x418 pixels for large image variants to avoid pixelation. Keep titles under 70 characters since Twitter truncates longer text in the card display. Test your cards after publishing by sharing the URL in a tweet draft to see the actual preview before posting publicly. Clear Twitter's cache by submitting your URL to their Card Validator if you update tags and don't see changes immediately."}
