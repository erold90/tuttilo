Students use the Pomodoro-style intervals for focused study blocks followed by scheduled break periods. Fitness enthusiasts track rest intervals between workout sets or run timed HIIT training sessions. Presenters rehearse speeches within strict time limits to ensure they fit allocated conference slots without running over.","p4":"Keep the browser tab visible or at least unmuted to hear the alarm when time expires—many browsers pause background tab timers. Add a 30-second buffer to critical timings like cooking to account for your reaction time when the alarm sounds. Use multiple browser windows with different timers for complex workflows requiring overlapping time tracking. For long durations over an hour, verify your computer won't go to sleep and pause the countdown. Write down your timer settings before closing the browser if you need to recreate the same interval later."}
