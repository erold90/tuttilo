Financial analysts compute percentage changes in stock prices, revenue, or other metrics. Students solve percentage problems for math homework or standardized tests. Budget planners determine what percentage of income goes to various expense categories. Sales teams calculate commission amounts as percentages of sales figures. Nutrition trackers determine what percentage of daily values are met by food portions.","p4":"For percentage of a number (X% of Y), the formula is (X/100) × Y. For \"what percentage\" calculations (X is what % of Y), it's (X/Y) × 100. Percentage change is calculated as ((New - Old) / Old) × 100, where negative results indicate decreases. When comparing percentage changes, remember that a 50% increase followed by a 50% decrease doesn't return to the original value. For financial calculations, understand the difference between percentage points and percentages—interest rising from 2% to 3% is a 1 percentage point increase but a 50% percentage increase. Round percentages appropriately based on context: 2-3 decimal places for precision, whole numbers for general communication."}
