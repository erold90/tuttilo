{"p2":"Type any text into the input field—keep it relatively short (under 20 characters) for the best visual results. Click generate, and the tool renders your text as ASCII art using a built-in block-letter font where each character is drawn using hash marks, slashes, and other ASCII characters. The output can be scaled to different sizes for various use cases. Copy the generated ASCII art to your clipboard for pasting into plain text environments like terminals, code comments, email signatures, or README files. All rendering happens instantly in your browser using character mapping algorithms.","p3":"Developers create eye-catching banners for command-line tools and script outputs. Programmers add decorative headers to source code files or configuration files. System administrators jazz up MOTD (message of the day) login screens on servers. README authors create memorable project titles in GitHub repository documentation. Retro computing enthusiasts generate text art for BBS systems and terminal-based applications. Social media users create text-based graphics that stand out in plain-text posts or bios.","p4":"Keep your input short—ASCII art width grows exponentially and becomes unwieldy with long text. Use uppercase letters for better visual consistency across different fonts. For multi-line banners, generate each line separately and combine them manually. Test your ASCII art in the actual environment where it will appear (terminal, editor, etc.) since character spacing varies. Monospace fonts are essential—ASCII art breaks in proportional fonts. For CLI tools, consider adding the ASCII art as a constant string in your code rather than generating it at runtime."}
