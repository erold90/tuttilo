{"p2":"Select which data fields you need from options including names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, dates of birth, and company information. Specify how many records to generate in a single batch, from one to hundreds. Click generate to produce realistic-looking test data that mimics real user information patterns. All data is randomly created in your browser using common name databases and formatting algorithms—no actual personal information is used or stored. Export results as JSON or CSV for importing into your development database or testing framework.","p3":"Software developers populate staging databases with thousands of realistic user records for performance and UI testing without privacy concerns. QA testers fill out registration forms repeatedly during automated testing without manually inventing unique credentials each time. Designers create mockups showing realistic user interfaces filled with plausible names and addresses instead of 'Lorem Ipsum' placeholders. Database administrators train new team members using safe synthetic datasets that look real but contain no actual customer information.","p4":"Generate more data than you need upfront to avoid inconsistent patterns if you have to generate multiple batches later. Use consistent seed values if your testing framework supports it to get reproducible fake data across test runs. Verify that generated phone numbers and postal codes match the geographic region you're simulating to catch validation bugs. Combine fake data generation with your own domain-specific field values like product IDs or category names for comprehensive test datasets. Never use this data for actual communication—while it looks real, the emails are invalid and addresses are likely nonsensical."}
