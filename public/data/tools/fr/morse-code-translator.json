{"p2":"Type regular text into the input field to convert it to Morse code, or enter Morse code (dots, dashes, and spaces) to decode it back to text. The tool supports all English letters (A-Z), digits (0-9), and common punctuation marks. Letter boundaries are indicated by spaces, and word boundaries by double spaces in Morse code. Click the play button to hear the audio representation of your Morse code at an adjustable speed (words per minute). The audio uses a standard tone frequency and follows proper Morse timing conventions. All translation happens in your browser using International Morse Code mappings.","p3":"Ham radio enthusiasts practice Morse code recognition and transmission skills. Students learning Morse code for certifications test their proficiency with text-to-Morse conversion. Puzzle and escape room designers create Morse code challenges and verify solutions. Scout leaders teach communication skills using Morse code activities. Emergency preparedness groups train alternative communication methods for situations without modern technology. Makers program LED blinkers or buzzers and need correct Morse patterns for their messages.","p4":"Standard Morse code timing uses the dot duration as the base unit: dashes are 3 units, gaps between symbols in a character are 1 unit, gaps between characters are 3 units, and gaps between words are 7 units. For learning, start at 5-10 WPM and gradually increase speed as you improve recognition. When transmitting, rhythm and consistency matter more than absolute speed. The SOS distress signal (··· --- ···) is universally recognized and requires no other knowledge. For practice, encode familiar phrases rather than random text to build pattern recognition."}
