{"p2":"Select any file from your device—documents, images, videos, archives, executables, or any other file type. The tool reads the entire file in chunks and computes four cryptographic hash values simultaneously: SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. Progress is shown as the file is processed, which is especially useful for large files over 100MB. Once complete, all four hash values are displayed in hexadecimal format, ready to copy. Compare these values against published checksums to verify file integrity and detect tampering. The entire file is processed locally in your browser using the SubtleCrypto API—nothing is uploaded.","p3":"Software developers verify downloaded libraries or binaries match the official release by comparing SHA-256 checksums. Security researchers confirm malware samples are identical to reported specimens using hash matching. System administrators validate ISO images downloaded for server installations haven't been corrupted or modified. Users verify that files downloaded from torrents or mirrors are authentic by checking against published hashes. Digital archivists create checksums for long-term storage to detect bit rot or corruption over time. Forensic analysts compute file hashes for evidence integrity and chain-of-custody documentation.","p4":"SHA-1 is considered cryptographically broken for security purposes—use SHA-256 or higher for integrity verification. When sharing files, publish the hash on a different channel (e.g., HTTPS website) than the file download itself to prevent attackers from replacing both. Large files may take several seconds to hash—this is normal and indicates thorough processing. For critical security applications, verify the hash using two different tools to rule out implementation bugs. File modification of even a single bit produces a completely different hash, making checksums excellent tamper-detection mechanisms."}
