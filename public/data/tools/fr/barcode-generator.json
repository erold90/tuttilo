{"p2":"Enter the text or numbers you want to encode as a barcode into the input field. The tool generates a Code 128 barcode automatically as you type, rendering it as a scannable image. Adjust the width and height dimensions to fit your printing or display requirements using the size controls. Preview the generated barcode to ensure it will scan properly at your chosen dimensions. Download the barcode as a high-resolution PNG image ready for printing on labels, packaging, or inclusion in documents. All barcode generation happens in Tuttilo using a client-side barcode library with no server uploads.","p3":"Small businesses create product barcodes for inventory tracking using affordable label printers instead of paying for UPC code registration. Event organizers generate unique ticket barcodes for entry scanning that prevent fraud and enable attendance tracking. Warehouse managers label storage locations with barcode identifiers for efficient picking and inventory management systems. Libraries create catalog labels with barcodes encoding book ISBNs for streamlined checkout and return processes.","p4":"Test your generated barcodes with an actual scanner before printing thousands of labels to verify readability at your chosen size. Maintain adequate quiet zones (blank space) on both sides of the barcode to prevent scanning errors. Use high contrast—black bars on white background work best for reliable scanning under various lighting conditions. Print barcodes at higher DPI (300 or above) to ensure sharp bar edges that scanners can differentiate clearly. Avoid scaling barcodes in design software after generation since it can introduce distortion—instead, generate at your target size directly."}
