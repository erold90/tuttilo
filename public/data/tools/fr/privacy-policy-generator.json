{"p2":"Enter your website or company name in the first field. Check the boxes corresponding to features your site actually uses: cookies, analytics, third-party advertising, newsletter subscriptions, user accounts, payment processing, or social media integration. For each selected feature, the generator includes the appropriate legal language and disclosure requirements. Add your contact email address for data subject requests. The tool instantly generates a complete privacy policy document based on your selections. Copy the generated text and paste it into your website's privacy policy page. Review and customize the template sections to match your specific data practices.","p3":"Startup founders create GDPR-compliant privacy policies before launching their minimum viable product. Bloggers establish legal protection when adding Google Analytics or email subscriptions to their sites. E-commerce site owners document their data collection practices when processing customer payments. App developers generate baseline privacy policies that can be reviewed by legal counsel. Website owners update their policies when adding new third-party integrations like chatbots or advertising networks. Students building portfolio sites ensure basic compliance when collecting contact form submissions.","p4":"This generator provides a starting template, but consult a lawyer for review if you collect sensitive data or operate in regulated industries. Be honest about which features you check—including unnecessary disclosures creates compliance burden, while omitting actual data collection practices creates legal risk. Update your privacy policy every time you add new tracking tools, analytics platforms, or data collection forms. Date your privacy policy and maintain an archive of previous versions to demonstrate compliance history. Place a prominent link to your privacy policy in your website footer on every page, not just during account signup."}
