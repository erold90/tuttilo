{"p2":"Upload a PDF containing tables and the tool analyzes page layout to identify columnar data, reconstructing it as native Excel cells with preserved row and column alignment. Text-based PDFs with clear table structures convert most reliably, while scanned documents may require OCR processing first for accurate data extraction. Converting from Excel to PDF transforms spreadsheets into fixed-layout documents that display consistently across devices, maintaining formulas as calculated values and preserving cell formatting. All conversion processing runs locally in your browser, keeping financial statements, sales reports, and budget spreadsheets private on your device.","p3":"Financial analysts convert quarterly earnings report PDFs from public companies into Excel format to build comparison models and perform ratio analysis. Small business owners transform scanned receipt images into Excel expense logs for bookkeeping and tax preparation. Marketing teams convert campaign performance PDFs from advertising platforms into editable spreadsheets for custom chart creation. Supply chain managers extract inventory data tables from vendor PDF catalogs into Excel for sorting, filtering, and reorder calculations. Researchers convert statistical tables from published journal article PDFs into Excel datasets for meta-analysis and replication studies.","p4":"Table detection works best when PDF data is organized in clear rows and columns with consistent spacing—merged cells and complex nested structures may require manual cleanup after conversion. Before converting important financial data, verify that numbers transferred correctly and formulas didn't get lost, especially for percentages and currency formats. When creating PDFs from Excel, freeze header rows and adjust page breaks beforehand to ensure tables don't split awkwardly across pages. If a PDF contains multiple separate tables, consider extracting them into individual Excel sheets rather than one combined worksheet. Test converted files by spot-checking several data points against the original to catch any extraction errors early."}
