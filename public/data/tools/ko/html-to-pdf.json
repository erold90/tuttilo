{"p2":"Paste HTML code directly into the editor and the tool renders it as a visual page before converting to PDF format. CSS styling and basic layout elements are preserved, allowing you to transform web content, email templates, or code snippets into shareable documents. This is particularly useful for archiving web pages, creating printable versions of online content, or generating reports from HTML-formatted data. The conversion processes entirely in your browser, so HTML containing proprietary information or embedded sensitive data never leaves your computer during PDF generation.","p3":"Web developers convert HTML email templates into PDF mockups for client approval before coding final responsive versions. Bloggers archive important web articles as PDFs to preserve formatting and content that might change or disappear from original sources. Data analysts convert HTML reports generated by analytics scripts into PDF format for distribution to stakeholders who prefer static documents. Legal teams save HTML-formatted contract drafts as PDFs to create timestamped records of agreement versions during negotiation. Teachers convert interactive HTML tutorials into printable PDF study guides for students without reliable internet access.","p4":"Keep HTML relatively simple for best conversion results—complex JavaScript, external stylesheets, and intricate CSS frameworks may not render perfectly in the PDF output. Inline CSS styles directly in your HTML rather than linking external files to ensure formatting transfers correctly. Test that images referenced in your HTML are accessible; broken image links will appear as placeholders in the final PDF. For multi-page content, use explicit page break CSS properties to control where pages divide rather than letting the converter decide automatically. If your HTML contains interactive elements like forms or buttons, remember these won't function in the static PDF—consider removing or replacing them with equivalent static content first."}
