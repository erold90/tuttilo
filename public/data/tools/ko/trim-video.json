Tutorial makers cut out pauses, restarts, or off-topic tangents to maintain pacing in instructional videos. Event videographers isolate specific speeches or performances from multi-hour ceremony recordings.","p4":"Leave a half-second buffer on each end of your desired clip to avoid cutting off the first or last word.
