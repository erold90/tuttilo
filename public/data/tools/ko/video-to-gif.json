{"p2":"Upload a video file and use the trim handles to select the segment you want to convert, typically 2-6 seconds for optimal GIF file size. Adjust the frames per second slider to control smoothness versus file size: higher FPS creates fluid motion but larger files. Set the output width in pixels, and the height scales proportionally. Click convert and the tool extracts frames from your video, quantizes colors using a 256-color palette, and encodes the animated GIF using the gifenc library entirely in your browser. Download the finished GIF when processing completes.","p3":"Social media users convert funny video moments into looping GIFs for sharing in chats, Reddit threads, or Twitter replies where video autoplay is disabled. Designers create animated product demos or UI interactions to embed in email campaigns or landing pages. Gamers capture epic moments from gameplay recordings to share as reaction GIFs in Discord servers. Tutorial creators illustrate short how-to steps with looping GIF sequences that viewers can watch repeatedly without video controls. Meme makers transform viral video clips into portable GIF format for easier embedding across platforms.","p4":"Keep GIF duration under 5 seconds to avoid massive file sizes that fail to upload on most platforms, which cap GIFs at 15-20 MB. Reduce output width to 480-600 pixels for social media, since GIFs above 1080p become impractically large. Lower FPS to 10-15 for simple motion like text or slow movements, but use 20-24 FPS for fast action to prevent choppy playback. Trim out static frames at the beginning or end to save space and create a perfect loop. Export from the highest quality video source available, as GIFs inherit compression artifacts from their source material."}
