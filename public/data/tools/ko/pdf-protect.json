{"p2":"Set a user password to require authentication before anyone can open your PDF, preventing unauthorized viewing of confidential content. Configure owner password controls to restrict specific actions like printing, copying text, editing pages, or form filling even after the document is opened. The tool encrypts your PDF and embeds permission flags recognized by PDF readers, enforcing restrictions on compliant software. All password protection and encryption happens locally in your browser, ensuring sensitive documents and passwords never transmit to external servers during the security process.","p3":"Law firms protect client case documents with passwords before sharing via email to ensure only intended recipients can view privileged communications. HR departments restrict copying and editing on employee handbook PDFs to prevent unauthorized modifications to company policies. Financial advisors password-protect retirement planning documents sent to clients containing social security numbers and account details. Consultants protect proprietary methodology guides and strategic reports to prevent clients from redistributing intellectual property. Healthcare providers restrict printing on patient medical record PDFs to maintain HIPAA compliance when sharing via secure portals.","p4":"Use strong, unique passwords combining letters, numbers, and symbols rather than simple phrases that are easy to guess or crack. Document your passwords securely in a password manager—losing the password to an important encrypted PDF can make data permanently inaccessible. Consider whether you need user password protection (prevents opening) or just permission restrictions (allows viewing but limits actions) based on your security requirements. Test protected PDFs on different PDF readers to verify restrictions work as expected, since enforcement varies across software. If sharing password-protected files, communicate passwords through a separate channel from the document itself to maintain security if one channel is compromised."}
