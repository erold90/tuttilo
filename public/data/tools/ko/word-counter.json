{"p2":"Type or paste your text into the input box and watch real-time statistics update automatically: total words, characters with and without spaces, sentences, and paragraphs. The tool parses your content using JavaScript string analysis, counting whitespace-delimited tokens as words and punctuation-terminated sequences as sentences. Results appear instantly without requiring any button clicks. Use the stats to verify document meets length requirements or track writing progress. All processing happens locally in your browser.","p3":"Students verify essays meet minimum word count requirements for assignments before submission to avoid grade penalties. Writers track daily word count progress toward novel, article, or blog post goals during drafting sessions. SEO specialists analyze content length to ensure pages hit target word counts for search engine ranking factors. Social media managers check character counts to stay within platform limits like Twitter's 280 characters or Facebook's post length recommendations. Translators count words in source documents to estimate project scope and calculate per-word pricing for clients.","p4":"Exclude headings, footnotes, and citations from your word count if your assignment or style guide doesn't include them. Use sentence count to identify run-on paragraphs or overly choppy writing that needs structural revision. Character count with spaces matches Microsoft Word's default, while character count without spaces matches Google Docs. For SEO, aim for 1000+ words on pillar pages and 500-800 for supporting articles to satisfy modern search algorithms. Track paragraph count to ensure content is broken into scannable sections rather than walls of text."}
