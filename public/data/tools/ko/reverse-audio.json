{"p2":"Upload an audio file and click the reverse button. The tool reads the audio data into memory, flips the sample order from end to beginning, and renders the reversed waveform. Processing happens entirely in your browser using Web Audio API, so files never leave your device. Preview the reversed audio to hear the backward effect. The result plays your audio in reverse chronological order, creating the classic backward-masking effect heard in experimental music and audio puzzles. Download the reversed file when ready.","p3":"Musicians create psychedelic or experimental effects by layering reversed vocals or instruments into songs. Audio engineers analyze recordings backward to detect hidden messages, edit points, or masking techniques. Sound designers generate eerie or otherworldly effects for horror films, sci-fi projects, or video games. Educators demonstrate wave properties and audio concepts by showing students how sound behaves in reverse. Puzzle creators embed backward audio clues in games or alternate reality experiences for players to decode.","p4":"Reverse your audio twice to return to the original if you need to undo the effect without re-uploading. For music, reverse specific instrument tracks rather than full mixes to create unique textures without destroying the entire arrangement. Combine reversed audio with reverb or delay effects to generate ambient soundscapes popular in lo-fi and vaporwave production. Export reversed speech to check if hidden messages exist in source material, though most \"backward masking\" claims are pareidolia. Use reversed percussion or cymbals as transitions or risers in music production, a technique common in electronic genres."}
