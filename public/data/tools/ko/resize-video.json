{"p2":"Upload a video and enter the desired output width and height in pixels. Common targets include 1920×1080 for full HD, 1280×720 for HD, or 640×480 for smaller web embeds. Toggle aspect ratio lock to maintain proportions or unlock to stretch the video to exact dimensions. The tool re-encodes your video at the new resolution using browser-based processing. Downscaling reduces file size, while upscaling enlarges smaller videos at the cost of added blur. Download the resized video when conversion completes.","p3":"Web developers resize videos to specific dimensions required by templates or content management systems. Social media managers downscale 4K uploads to 1080p to speed up processing and save bandwidth. Mobile users resize large desktop recordings to smaller dimensions for easier sharing via messaging apps. Video editors upscale lower-resolution archival footage to match modern project standards, accepting some quality loss. Presenters resize videos to fit slide deck layouts or digital signage display resolutions.","p4":"Always downscale rather than upscale when possible, as adding pixels through interpolation introduces blur and artifacts. Maintain aspect ratio to prevent distorted, stretched video unless the target use case demands exact dimensions. Resize once to the final output size rather than multiple intermediate steps to minimize cumulative quality loss. For web use, test the resized video on mobile and desktop to confirm it displays correctly at the new dimensions. Combine resizing with compression to achieve both smaller dimensions and reduced file size in one pass."}
