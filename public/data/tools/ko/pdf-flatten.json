{"p2":"Flattening converts all interactive form fields, annotations, and comments into static page content that becomes part of the permanent document image. After flattening, text previously entered in fillable fields can no longer be edited, dropdown selections become fixed text, and annotation layers merge into the background. This process is irreversible, so the tool creates a new flattened copy while preserving your original file. All flattening happens in your browser, keeping documents containing completed personal information or business data private on your device throughout the transformation.","p3":"Government agencies flatten completed application forms before archiving to prevent accidental data modification in official records. Legal departments flatten signed contracts after execution to ensure terms cannot be altered during storage and future reference. HR teams flatten completed employee onboarding forms to create permanent personnel file records that prevent subsequent editing. Financial institutions flatten loan applications containing customer signatures to maintain unalterable records for compliance audits. Educational administrators flatten student enrollment forms with parent signatures to preserve official registration documentation that cannot be tampered with.","p4":"Always verify that all required fields are completed correctly before flattening, since you cannot edit form data afterward without recreating the entire document. Flatten documents after collecting final signatures but before long-term archiving to prevent format compatibility issues with future PDF software versions. If you need to maintain an editable version for updates, save the original separately before flattening and clearly label which file is the permanent record. Flattening also locks down annotations and comments, so ensure all reviewer feedback has been addressed before making changes permanent. Check that flattened documents display correctly across different PDF viewers, as some complex form elements may render slightly differently after merging into page content."}
