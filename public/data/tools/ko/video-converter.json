{"p2":"Upload a video in any supported format, then select your desired output format from the dropdown menu. Common choices include MP4 for universal compatibility, WebM for web embedding, or AVI for editing software. Click convert and the tool re-encodes your video using browser-based processing powered by MediaRecorder API. Conversion time scales with video length and resolution; a 5-minute 1080p clip may take several minutes. Download the converted file when encoding finishes, with your original file remaining intact on your device.","p3":"Video editors convert raw footage from cameras that record in proprietary formats into standard MP4 for compatibility with editing software. Web developers convert MP4 videos to WebM for smaller file sizes and better HTML5 video performance. Mobile users convert old AVI or MKV files to MP4 for playback on smartphones and tablets that don't support legacy codecs. Content archivists standardize mixed-format video libraries into a single consistent format for long-term storage. Cross-platform teams convert between formats to ensure videos play on both Mac and Windows machines.","p4":"Convert to MP4 with H.264 codec for maximum compatibility across devices, browsers, and media players. Choose WebM for web use when file size matters more than broad legacy device support. Avoid converting between lossy formats repeatedly, as each conversion degrades quality through re-compression. Keep frame rate and resolution the same as the source unless you specifically need to downscale. Test the converted file on the target device or platform before deleting the original, since codec quirks can cause unexpected playback issues."}
