{"p2":"Upload two versions of the same document and the tool displays them side by side with synchronized scrolling for visual inspection. A difference analysis runs pixel-level comparison to identify modified text, added content, deleted sections, and formatting changes between versions. The tool calculates an overall difference percentage and highlights changed areas, making it easy to spot revisions quickly. All comparison processing happens locally in your browser, so confidential contract drafts or proprietary document versions never leave your device during the analysis.","p3":"Legal teams compare contract draft versions to verify all requested changes were implemented before client signing. Quality assurance reviewers compare training manual revisions to ensure updated procedures replaced outdated instructions correctly. Compliance officers compare policy document versions to identify what changed between annual reviews for change log documentation. Editors compare manuscript draft iterations to confirm author revisions addressed all editorial feedback. Financial auditors compare report versions to trace when and where discrepancies were introduced during document preparation.","p4":"For most accurate comparison, ensure both PDFs are the same page size and orientation—misaligned pages will show false differences even if content is identical. Text-based PDFs compare more reliably than scanned images where slight scan variations can trigger false positive differences. When reviewing comparison results, focus on meaningful content changes rather than minor rendering differences in fonts or spacing. If the tool reports high difference percentages for supposedly similar documents, check that you're comparing the right versions—completely different files will show near 100% difference. Use this tool to verify changes rather than identify what specifically changed; for detailed text diffs, consider converting to Word and using track changes."}
