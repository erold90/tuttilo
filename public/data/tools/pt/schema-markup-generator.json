{"p2":"Choose from multiple schema types including Article, Product, Recipe, Event, Organization, and LocalBusiness. Fill in the relevant fields for your selected schema type—required properties are clearly marked. The tool generates clean JSON-LD structured data that search engines can easily parse. All processing occurs locally in Tuttilo, protecting your business information. Copy the generated JSON-LD code and paste it into a script tag in your HTML head or body section to enable rich snippets in search results.","p3":"Local businesses add LocalBusiness schema to appear in map packs with hours, phone numbers, and reviews prominently displayed. Recipe bloggers implement Recipe schema to show cooking time, ratings, and calorie counts directly in search results. E-commerce sites use Product schema to display prices, availability, and star ratings in Google Shopping results. Event organizers ensure their concerts and conferences appear with dates, venues, and ticket links in specialized event search features.","p4":"Validate your generated schema using Google's Rich Results Test before deploying to catch errors that could prevent rich snippets. Use Organization schema on your homepage to establish your brand identity across Google's knowledge graph. Combine multiple schema types on a single page when appropriate—a recipe blog post can include both Article and Recipe markup. Keep your schema data synchronized with visible page content since mismatches can trigger manual penalties. Update schema when page content changes, particularly for time-sensitive fields like event dates or product prices.","p5":"Yes, JSON-LD is Google's recommended structured data format. It's cleaner than microdata or RDFa alternatives because it keeps markup separate from HTML content, making it easier to manage and less likely to break during site updates."}
