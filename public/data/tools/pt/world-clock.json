{"p2":"The clock displays current time for major cities across all inhabited continents, updating every second in real-time. Each city shows its timezone name, current hour in 24-hour format, and date. The interface groups cities by continent for easy scanning of regional times. Add or remove cities using the customization controls to focus on locations relevant to your needs. Everything runs in your browser using your device's system clock and timezone database. The clock continues running accurately even without internet connection after initial page load.","p3":"Global customer support teams staff their overnight shifts based on peak hours in key markets displayed on the world clock. Stock market traders watch for exchange opening times in Tokyo, London, and New York to capitalize on market-moving events. Remote workers in different continents check what time it is for colleagues before sending messages or scheduling impromptu calls. International families coordinate video calls with relatives abroad by finding times that work across multiple timezone locations simultaneously.","p4":"Set the world clock as your browser's default new tab page to always have instant timezone awareness when opening your browser. Use the 24-hour format to avoid AM/PM confusion when calculating working hours across the international date line. Note which cities are currently in daylight saving time by checking for one-hour shifts from their standard offset. For critical time-sensitive coordination, confirm the other party's actual local time rather than assuming based on their city, as rural areas sometimes differ from major urban centers.","p5":"Yes, the clock uses your browser's date/time API which updates continuously. However, accuracy depends on your device's system clock being set correctly. If your system time is wrong, all displayed times will be offset accordingly."}
