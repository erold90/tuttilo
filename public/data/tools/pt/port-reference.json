{"p2":"Browse the comprehensive list of well-known and registered TCP and UDP ports, or use the search box to find specific services by port number or name. Click the protocol filter buttons to show only TCP, only UDP, or both protocols. Each entry displays the port number, protocol, and the service or application that typically uses it. The reference includes ports 0-1023 (well-known ports) and many commonly used registered ports up to 65535. All data is built into the tool and loads instantly without internet access, making it useful for offline troubleshooting.","p3":"System administrators verify which services are running on specific ports during security audits. Network engineers troubleshoot firewall rules by looking up the standard port for a service. Security analysts investigate unusual network traffic by researching unfamiliar port numbers in logs. Developers choose appropriate port numbers for custom applications while avoiding conflicts with standard services. Students learning networking memorize common port associations for certification exams. Penetration testers identify services running on non-standard ports during reconnaissance phases.","p4":"Memorize the most critical ports for quick recognition: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 3389 (RDP), 3306 (MySQL), 5432 (PostgreSQL). Remember that many services can run on non-standard ports for security through obscurity, though this shouldn't replace proper security measures. TCP and UDP port numbers are independent—port 53 TCP and port 53 UDP are different services (though DNS uses both). Ephemeral ports (49152-65535) are dynamically assigned for client connections. When designing custom services, choose ports above 1024 to avoid requiring root privileges on Unix systems.","p5":"The reference database includes IANA-assigned port numbers for well-known services and commonly used applications. Entries are searchable by port number or service name using case-insensitive matching. TCP and UDP protocols are indicated separately since the same port number can be used for different services on different protocols. The search function filters results in real-time as you type. No external API calls are made—the entire port database is embedded in the application for instant access and offline functionality."}
