{"p2":"Start with a preset gradient or create a custom one by selecting two or more colors using the color pickers. Choose the gradient direction (linear, radial, or diagonal angles) and adjust the color stop positions for precise control. Set your desired wallpaper resolution from common presets (1920x1080, 2560x1440, 3840x2160) or enter custom dimensions. The preview canvas shows your gradient in real-time. When ready, click the download button to save your wallpaper as a high-quality PNG file. All rendering happens in your browser using HTML5 Canvas, ensuring your color choices and resolution settings remain private.","p3":"Remote workers create calming desktop backgrounds that reduce eye strain during long work sessions. Content creators generate custom backgrounds for video calls, YouTube thumbnails, and social media graphics. Graphic designers produce base layers for further editing in design software without starting from scratch. Minimalist enthusiasts craft subtle wallpapers that complement their desktop aesthetic without distracting from work. Developers test monitor color accuracy and gradient banding by generating smooth multi-stop gradients. Multiple monitor setups benefit from generating matching wallpapers at different aspect ratios that share the same color scheme.","p4":"For the smoothest gradients without banding, use colors with similar saturation levels and avoid transitioning directly between complementary hues. Generate wallpapers at your display's native resolution rather than scaling from lower sizes to prevent blur. For multi-monitor setups, create gradients with the combined resolution (e.g., 3840x1080 for dual 1920x1080 displays) to flow seamlessly across screens. Add a third color stop in the middle of your gradient to create more complex color transitions. Test your gradient on different backgrounds in your OS theme to ensure good contrast with desktop icons and window elements.","p5":"The Canvas API renders gradients with smooth color interpolation in the sRGB color space. High-resolution outputs (4K and above) are generated using efficient chunked rendering to prevent browser memory limitations. Linear gradients support any angle from 0-360 degrees for precise directional control. Radial gradients emanate from the center point with customizable radius. The PNG export uses maximum quality settings with no compression artifacts in gradient areas."}
