{"p2":"Start a work session with the default 25-minute focus period, during which the timer counts down while you concentrate on a single task. When the work interval completes, a notification alerts you to take a 5-minute break. After completing four work sessions, the tool automatically schedules a longer 15-minute break to prevent burnout. Track your completed pomodoros in the session counter to measure daily productivity. The timer runs entirely in your browser with optional sound notifications. Pause, skip, or reset the session anytime to adapt the technique to your actual workflow interruptions.","p3":"Software developers maintain deep focus during complex coding sessions while ensuring regular breaks to prevent mental fatigue. Writers tackle article drafts in structured intervals that balance creative flow with necessary rest periods. Students prepare for exams using timed study blocks that maximize information retention through spaced practice. Freelancers track billable hours and maintain work-life boundaries by committing to specific numbers of pomodoros per client project daily.","p4":"During your 25-minute work session, close all communication apps and browser tabs unrelated to your current task to protect your focus. Use the 5-minute breaks for physical movement rather than screen time to genuinely rest your eyes and mind. Adjust the default timing if 25 minutes proves too long or short for your attention span, though research suggests this duration optimizes focus for most people. Start tracking which types of tasks fit cleanly into single pomodoros versus requiring multiple sessions to inform better time estimates. Don't interrupt a running pomodoro for minor distractions—note them down to address during the next break instead.","p5":"The Pomodoro Technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. He used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer (pomodoro is Italian for tomato), which gave the productivity method its distinctive name."}
