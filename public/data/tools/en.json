{"compress-pdf":{"p2":"Upload your PDF file and Tuttilo's compression engine analyzes each page to identify opportunities for size reduction. The tool applies intelligent optimization to images, fonts, and embedded content while preserving text clarity and visual fidelity. You can choose between different compression levels depending on whether you prioritize file size or maximum quality. Since everything runs in your browser, sensitive documents like financial reports or legal contracts never reach external servers, ensuring complete privacy during the compression process.","p3":"Students frequently use this tool to compress research papers and thesis drafts before submitting them through university portals with strict file size limits. Marketing professionals rely on it to shrink presentation materials and product catalogs for email distribution without exceeding attachment size restrictions. Real estate agents compress property brochures and listing documents to ensure fast loading times when sharing portfolios with clients. Legal departments use it to reduce the size of contract bundles and case files before uploading to court e-filing systems that impose strict size caps.","p4":"For optimal results, compress PDFs that contain high-resolution photos or scanned images, where size reductions of 60-80% are common. Documents with primarily text and vector graphics may see smaller improvements since they're already efficiently stored. Avoid compressing the same file multiple times, as quality degradation compounds with each pass. If you need to preserve exact color fidelity for professional printing, test a sample page first before compressing an entire document. Consider creating two versions—a compressed one for digital distribution and an uncompressed master for archival purposes."},"pdf-organizer":{"p2":"This unified tool handles three core PDF operations without switching between separate utilities. Drop multiple PDFs to merge them into a single document, maintaining the original page order or rearranging files as needed. Use the split function to extract specific page ranges from lengthy reports or break multi-chapter documents into individual files. The rotation feature lets you correct pages that were scanned upside down or in landscape orientation. All operations process locally in your browser, so confidential business documents or personal records remain on your device throughout the entire workflow.","p3":"Administrative assistants merge individual invoices, receipts, and shipping documents into comprehensive monthly financial packages for accounting departments. Teachers combine student assignments, rubrics, and feedback sheets into single graded submission files. Project managers split large specification documents into separate sections for different contractor teams. Researchers rotate scanned journal articles and book chapters to proper orientation before adding them to reference libraries. HR departments merge offer letters, benefit summaries, and policy handbooks into complete new-hire onboarding packets.","p4":"When merging files, arrange them in the correct sequence before processing to avoid having to repeat the operation. For large documents, split by logical chapter breaks or content sections rather than arbitrary page counts to maintain coherent file organization. Double-check page rotation results, especially for mixed-orientation documents where some pages are deliberately landscape. If you're extracting specific pages repeatedly, note the page numbers beforehand to streamline future split operations. Keep originals until you verify merged or split files are complete and properly formatted."},"pdf-word":{"p2":"Drag a PDF file to convert it into an editable DOCX document, preserving text formatting, tables, and basic layout structure. The tool analyzes PDF content and reconstructs it as native Word elements rather than embedded images, allowing you to modify text, adjust formatting, and reflow content. Converting in the opposite direction creates PDFs from Word files while maintaining fonts, styles, and page structure. The bidirectional conversion runs entirely within your browser using client-side processing libraries, ensuring documents containing proprietary information or confidential data never leave your computer.","p3":"Freelance writers convert client-provided PDF briefs into Word documents to add tracked changes and editorial comments during the revision process. HR managers transform PDF job descriptions into editable templates for creating new position postings with updated requirements. Consultants convert proposal PDFs received from partners into Word format to merge sections and customize content for specific clients. Academic administrators turn PDF course syllabi into editable Word files for faculty to update semester schedules and reading lists. Small business owners convert vendor contracts from PDF to Word to mark up terms before sending to legal review.","p4":"PDF-to-Word conversion works best with text-based documents rather than scanned images, which require OCR processing separately. Complex layouts with multiple columns, text boxes, or intricate graphics may require manual formatting adjustments after conversion. Before converting important documents, check that all special characters and symbols transferred correctly, particularly mathematical notation or foreign language text. When creating PDFs from Word, use high-quality settings if the document contains detailed charts or diagrams. Save converted files under new names to preserve the original in case you need to reference the source formatting."},"pdf-editor":{"p2":"Load your PDF and click anywhere on the page to insert new text with automatic font and size matching to blend seamlessly with existing content. The tool detects fonts already used in the document and attempts to replicate them, though complex or proprietary fonts fall back to standard alternatives. Beyond text editing, you can draw freehand annotations, highlight passages, and add shapes or arrows for visual markup. All editing operations modify a copy of your document locally in the browser, leaving the original file unchanged on your device until you explicitly download the edited version.","p3":"Property managers fill in tenant information on standardized lease agreement templates without printing and rescanning. Educators annotate student essay PDFs with margin comments and correction marks before returning graded assignments. Construction supervisors markup architectural plans with revision notes and measurement corrections for contractor teams. Medical office staff add patient appointment details and insurance codes to blank intake form templates. Event planners edit venue contract PDFs to insert specific dates, attendee counts, and customized catering requirements before submitting to suppliers.","p4":"For best font matching, stick to common typefaces like Arial, Helvetica, or Times New Roman that are universally available across systems. When adding substantial new text, check that line spacing and alignment match surrounding content to avoid obvious visual inconsistencies. Use the drawing tools sparingly on text-heavy documents to prevent obscuring important information—lighter colors and thinner lines work better for annotations. If font matching fails, consider replacing entire text blocks rather than mixing mismatched fonts within paragraphs. Always preview the final page before downloading to catch alignment issues or text overflow that may not be obvious during editing."},"pdf-fill-sign":{"p2":"Click on any form field to type responses directly into text boxes, checkboxes, and dropdown menus without printing the document. The signature feature lets you draw your signature using a mouse or trackpad, type your name in script font, or upload an image of your handwritten signature saved from a previous signing. Position signatures and initials precisely where required by dragging them to the appropriate lines. Since form filling and signing happen entirely in your browser, sensitive information like social security numbers, bank account details, or medical data never gets transmitted to external servers during the process.","p3":"Remote employees sign employment contracts, non-disclosure agreements, and direct deposit authorization forms for new jobs without printing or mailing physical paperwork. Parents complete school permission slips, emergency contact forms, and field trip waivers electronically before deadlines. Loan applicants fill out mortgage pre-qualification forms and sign disclosure documents from home instead of visiting bank branches. Medical patients complete intake questionnaires and HIPAA consent forms before telehealth appointments. Freelancers sign client service agreements and project proposals while negotiating terms via email, eliminating delays from postal delivery.","p4":"Create a reusable signature image once and save it separately for quick insertion into future documents rather than redrawing each time. Before signing important contracts, read the entire document carefully—the convenience of digital signing shouldn't rush critical decisions. For forms with many fields, tab through entries systematically to avoid skipping required information that could invalidate the submission. If a signature looks pixelated or unclear after placement, redraw it at a larger size before shrinking to fit the signature line. Save a copy of the completed form before submitting it to maintain your own records of what was signed and when."},"pdf-images":{"p2":"Converting PDFs to images extracts each page as a separate high-resolution JPG or PNG file, useful for sharing specific pages on social media or embedding in presentations. Going the other direction, you can select multiple image files to combine them into a single multi-page PDF with each photo appearing on its own page. Choose output quality and resolution settings to balance file size against image clarity based on your intended use. The bidirectional conversion happens entirely in your browser, so vacation photos, design mockups, or business graphics remain private throughout the transformation process.","p3":"Graphic designers convert finished PDF mockups into PNG images with transparent backgrounds for client presentations and portfolio websites. Social media managers extract infographic pages from multi-page PDF reports to share as individual Instagram posts or Twitter cards. E-commerce sellers combine product photos into PDF catalogs for wholesale buyers to download complete collections. Real estate photographers merge property images into PDF showing packages for listing agents to share with potential buyers. Students convert lecture slide PDFs into individual images to insert specific diagrams into research papers and study guides.","p4":"Use PNG output format when you need transparent backgrounds or sharp text clarity, while JPG works better for photographs where smaller file sizes matter more than perfect quality. When creating PDFs from images, arrange files in the correct order before conversion since reordering afterward requires additional tools. For scanned documents being converted to PDF, ensure consistent image orientation beforehand to avoid mixed portrait and landscape pages. If converting PDFs with complex graphics or gradients to images, choose higher DPI settings to prevent visible pixelation in the output. Consider compression settings carefully when batch converting multiple pages—very high quality can produce unwieldy file sizes."},"pdf-excel":{"p2":"Upload a PDF containing tables and the tool analyzes page layout to identify columnar data, reconstructing it as native Excel cells with preserved row and column alignment. Text-based PDFs with clear table structures convert most reliably, while scanned documents may require OCR processing first for accurate data extraction. Converting from Excel to PDF transforms spreadsheets into fixed-layout documents that display consistently across devices, maintaining formulas as calculated values and preserving cell formatting. All conversion processing runs locally in your browser, keeping financial statements, sales reports, and budget spreadsheets private on your device.","p3":"Financial analysts convert quarterly earnings report PDFs from public companies into Excel format to build comparison models and perform ratio analysis. Small business owners transform scanned receipt images into Excel expense logs for bookkeeping and tax preparation. Marketing teams convert campaign performance PDFs from advertising platforms into editable spreadsheets for custom chart creation. Supply chain managers extract inventory data tables from vendor PDF catalogs into Excel for sorting, filtering, and reorder calculations. Researchers convert statistical tables from published journal article PDFs into Excel datasets for meta-analysis and replication studies.","p4":"Table detection works best when PDF data is organized in clear rows and columns with consistent spacing—merged cells and complex nested structures may require manual cleanup after conversion. Before converting important financial data, verify that numbers transferred correctly and formulas didn't get lost, especially for percentages and currency formats. When creating PDFs from Excel, freeze header rows and adjust page breaks beforehand to ensure tables don't split awkwardly across pages. If a PDF contains multiple separate tables, consider extracting them into individual Excel sheets rather than one combined worksheet. Test converted files by spot-checking several data points against the original to catch any extraction errors early."},"pdf-pptx":{"p2":"Load a PDF to convert each page into an individual PowerPoint slide, allowing you to extract presentation content for editing and customization. The tool attempts to preserve text, images, and layout positioning, though complex PDF designs may require adjustment in PowerPoint after conversion. Going the reverse direction, PPTX files become fixed-layout PDFs suitable for distribution when you want to prevent recipients from altering slides or when presenting on systems without PowerPoint installed. All conversion happens in your browser using client-side processing, so proprietary business presentations and confidential pitch decks never upload to external servers.","p3":"Sales teams convert competitor pitch decks received as PDFs into editable PowerPoint format to analyze messaging strategies and visual approaches. Conference speakers transform submitted PDF presentation files into PPTX to add custom branding and speaker notes before delivering talks. Training coordinators convert educational PDF modules into PowerPoint to incorporate interactive quizzes and discussion prompts for live workshops. Marketing agencies transform client-provided PDF brand guidelines into PowerPoint templates for creating consistent promotional materials. Consultants convert proposal PDFs from one client into reusable PowerPoint slide libraries for customizing future pitches to similar industries.","p4":"PDF-to-PowerPoint conversion works most reliably on presentations originally created in slide software rather than complex multi-column documents designed for printing. After conversion, check that images maintained proper resolution and alignment, especially logos and charts that need to stay pixel-perfect. When creating PDFs from PowerPoint, use high-quality export settings if slides contain detailed diagrams or photographs that will be viewed on large displays. Embedded videos and animations won't transfer during conversion—note their positions and re-add them manually if needed. If you're converting to modify a few slides, consider editing just those pages as images rather than converting the entire presentation."},"html-to-pdf":{"p2":"Paste HTML code directly into the editor and the tool renders it as a visual page before converting to PDF format. CSS styling and basic layout elements are preserved, allowing you to transform web content, email templates, or code snippets into shareable documents. This is particularly useful for archiving web pages, creating printable versions of online content, or generating reports from HTML-formatted data. The conversion processes entirely in your browser, so HTML containing proprietary information or embedded sensitive data never leaves your computer during PDF generation.","p3":"Web developers convert HTML email templates into PDF mockups for client approval before coding final responsive versions. Bloggers archive important web articles as PDFs to preserve formatting and content that might change or disappear from original sources. Data analysts convert HTML reports generated by analytics scripts into PDF format for distribution to stakeholders who prefer static documents. Legal teams save HTML-formatted contract drafts as PDFs to create timestamped records of agreement versions during negotiation. Teachers convert interactive HTML tutorials into printable PDF study guides for students without reliable internet access.","p4":"Keep HTML relatively simple for best conversion results—complex JavaScript, external stylesheets, and intricate CSS frameworks may not render perfectly in the PDF output. Inline CSS styles directly in your HTML rather than linking external files to ensure formatting transfers correctly. Test that images referenced in your HTML are accessible; broken image links will appear as placeholders in the final PDF. For multi-page content, use explicit page break CSS properties to control where pages divide rather than letting the converter decide automatically. If your HTML contains interactive elements like forms or buttons, remember these won't function in the static PDF—consider removing or replacing them with equivalent static content first."},"unlock-pdf":{"p2":"Upload a password-protected PDF and if you have the correct password, the tool removes restrictions that prevent printing, copying, or editing. Some PDFs have user passwords (required to open the file) while others have owner passwords (that restrict permissions)—this tool handles both types when credentials are provided. The unlocking process strips security metadata and creates an unrestricted copy of the document. All processing occurs locally in your browser, so documents containing confidential information remain on your device and passwords aren't transmitted to any server during the unlock operation.","p3":"Remote workers unlock company PDF documents received with outdated passwords to enable copying text for reports after the original document creator left the organization. Researchers remove printing restrictions from archived journal articles to create physical reference copies for offline study. Legal assistants unlock case file PDFs to enable text selection and copying when extracting quotes for briefs and motions. Small business owners remove editing restrictions from vendor-supplied PDF forms to customize fields and branding for their specific operations. Archivists unlock historical PDF documents where original passwords are documented in institutional records but restrictions prevent digital preservation workflows.","p4":"This tool only removes restrictions from PDFs where you already have access—it cannot crack or bypass unknown passwords, which would violate security protections. If you frequently receive protected documents from the same source, request unrestricted versions to avoid repetitive unlocking. Before unlocking documents for editing, verify you have legal authority to modify them since some restrictions are intentionally placed to prevent unauthorized changes. Save unlocked versions under clearly labeled filenames to distinguish them from the original protected copies. Remember that removing protection doesn't enhance document quality or repair corrupted files—it only eliminates access restrictions."},"pdf-protect":{"p2":"Set a user password to require authentication before anyone can open your PDF, preventing unauthorized viewing of confidential content. Configure owner password controls to restrict specific actions like printing, copying text, editing pages, or form filling even after the document is opened. The tool encrypts your PDF and embeds permission flags recognized by PDF readers, enforcing restrictions on compliant software. All password protection and encryption happens locally in your browser, ensuring sensitive documents and passwords never transmit to external servers during the security process.","p3":"Law firms protect client case documents with passwords before sharing via email to ensure only intended recipients can view privileged communications. HR departments restrict copying and editing on employee handbook PDFs to prevent unauthorized modifications to company policies. Financial advisors password-protect retirement planning documents sent to clients containing social security numbers and account details. Consultants protect proprietary methodology guides and strategic reports to prevent clients from redistributing intellectual property. Healthcare providers restrict printing on patient medical record PDFs to maintain HIPAA compliance when sharing via secure portals.","p4":"Use strong, unique passwords combining letters, numbers, and symbols rather than simple phrases that are easy to guess or crack. Document your passwords securely in a password manager—losing the password to an important encrypted PDF can make data permanently inaccessible. Consider whether you need user password protection (prevents opening) or just permission restrictions (allows viewing but limits actions) based on your security requirements. Test protected PDFs on different PDF readers to verify restrictions work as expected, since enforcement varies across software. If sharing password-protected files, communicate passwords through a separate channel from the document itself to maintain security if one channel is compromised."},"pdf-flatten":{"p2":"Flattening converts all interactive form fields, annotations, and comments into static page content that becomes part of the permanent document image. After flattening, text previously entered in fillable fields can no longer be edited, dropdown selections become fixed text, and annotation layers merge into the background. This process is irreversible, so the tool creates a new flattened copy while preserving your original file. All flattening happens in your browser, keeping documents containing completed personal information or business data private on your device throughout the transformation.","p3":"Government agencies flatten completed application forms before archiving to prevent accidental data modification in official records. Legal departments flatten signed contracts after execution to ensure terms cannot be altered during storage and future reference. HR teams flatten completed employee onboarding forms to create permanent personnel file records that prevent subsequent editing. Financial institutions flatten loan applications containing customer signatures to maintain unalterable records for compliance audits. Educational administrators flatten student enrollment forms with parent signatures to preserve official registration documentation that cannot be tampered with.","p4":"Always verify that all required fields are completed correctly before flattening, since you cannot edit form data afterward without recreating the entire document. Flatten documents after collecting final signatures but before long-term archiving to prevent format compatibility issues with future PDF software versions. If you need to maintain an editable version for updates, save the original separately before flattening and clearly label which file is the permanent record. Flattening also locks down annotations and comments, so ensure all reviewer feedback has been addressed before making changes permanent. Check that flattened documents display correctly across different PDF viewers, as some complex form elements may render slightly differently after merging into page content."},"pdf-crop":{"p2":"Adjust margin sliders to trim white space or remove unwanted borders from all pages simultaneously, creating a more compact document with larger content relative to page size. The visual preview shows exactly what area will be retained, letting you fine-tune crop boundaries before applying changes. This is especially useful for PDFs that were scanned with excessive margins or documents where binding margins need removal for digital distribution. All cropping calculations happen in your browser, keeping documents containing sensitive diagrams or proprietary content private on your device during the margin adjustment process.","p3":"Architects crop construction drawings to remove title block margins when sending detail views to subcontractors who only need specific sections. Students trim scanned textbook pages to eliminate page numbers and headers, maximizing content size for tablet reading. Graphic designers crop presentation PDFs to remove placeholder margins added during template creation. Researchers crop journal article scans to eliminate library watermarks and binding margins for cleaner personal reference files. Publishers crop submitted manuscript PDFs to remove author contact information and metadata before sending to anonymous peer reviewers.","p4":"Preview the crop on several representative pages before applying to ensure you're not accidentally trimming important content from pages with varying layouts. For documents with intentional margin differences across pages (like wider binding edges), cropping uniformly may cut off content on some pages while leaving excess margin on others. If you need to crop different pages differently, consider splitting the PDF first, cropping sections separately, then merging them back together. Leave slightly more margin than the minimum to account for printer tolerances if the cropped PDF will eventually be printed. Check that page numbers, footnotes, or headers aren't positioned in margins you're removing—they'll disappear after cropping."},"pdf-compare":{"p2":"Upload two versions of the same document and the tool displays them side by side with synchronized scrolling for visual inspection. A difference analysis runs pixel-level comparison to identify modified text, added content, deleted sections, and formatting changes between versions. The tool calculates an overall difference percentage and highlights changed areas, making it easy to spot revisions quickly. All comparison processing happens locally in your browser, so confidential contract drafts or proprietary document versions never leave your device during the analysis.","p3":"Legal teams compare contract draft versions to verify all requested changes were implemented before client signing. Quality assurance reviewers compare training manual revisions to ensure updated procedures replaced outdated instructions correctly. Compliance officers compare policy document versions to identify what changed between annual reviews for change log documentation. Editors compare manuscript draft iterations to confirm author revisions addressed all editorial feedback. Financial auditors compare report versions to trace when and where discrepancies were introduced during document preparation.","p4":"For most accurate comparison, ensure both PDFs are the same page size and orientation—misaligned pages will show false differences even if content is identical. Text-based PDFs compare more reliably than scanned images where slight scan variations can trigger false positive differences. When reviewing comparison results, focus on meaningful content changes rather than minor rendering differences in fonts or spacing. If the tool reports high difference percentages for supposedly similar documents, check that you're comparing the right versions—completely different files will show near 100% difference. Use this tool to verify changes rather than identify what specifically changed; for detailed text diffs, consider converting to Word and using track changes."},"pdf-page-numbers":{"p2":"Select where you want page numbers to appear (top or bottom, left, center, or right) and configure the starting number and format style. The tool adds numbers to all pages consistently, using a font size and style that complements your document. You can exclude the first page if it's a cover sheet or begin numbering from a specific page in the middle of the document. All page numbering happens in your browser, keeping documents containing proprietary information or confidential content private on your device during the numbering process.","p3":"Students add page numbers to thesis drafts to meet university formatting requirements before final submission. Lawyers number exhibit pages in case filings to comply with court document formatting rules. Technical writers add page numbers to user manuals so support teams can reference specific pages during customer troubleshooting calls. Event planners number conference program PDFs to help attendees navigate session schedules and venue maps. HR departments add page numbers to employee handbooks to facilitate easier reference during policy discussions and training sessions.","p4":"Check existing page numbers before adding new ones to avoid creating duplicates if some pages already have numbering. For documents that will be printed and bound, position numbers with sufficient margin clearance to prevent trimming during the binding process. If your document has distinct sections requiring different numbering styles (like Roman numerals for front matter), consider splitting the PDF, numbering sections separately, then merging them back together. Choose font sizes large enough to be legible but not so prominent that they distract from page content. Preview several pages across the document before finalizing to ensure consistent placement, especially if pages have varying content layouts."},"pdf-watermark":{"p2":"Type your watermark text and adjust font size, opacity, rotation angle, and positioning to create either subtle branding or prominent copyright protection. The watermark applies to all pages simultaneously with consistent placement and styling. You can make watermarks nearly transparent for background branding or highly opaque to prevent unauthorized use of documents. All watermarking happens locally in your browser, keeping proprietary presentations and confidential reports private on your device while adding protection layers.","p3":"Photographers watermark portfolio PDFs with copyright notices before sending work samples to potential clients to discourage unauthorized use. Consultants add \"Confidential Draft\" watermarks to proposal versions shared during client review to prevent premature external distribution. Real estate agencies watermark property listing PDFs with agency branding to maintain attribution when agents share materials with buyers. Academic researchers watermark preprint PDFs with \"Not for Distribution\" labels before circulating to peer reviewers. Law firms watermark discovery document PDFs with case numbers and confidentiality designations for organized case management.","p4":"Set watermark opacity between 20-40% for subtle background branding that doesn't interfere with document readability, or use 80-100% for prominent protection on sensitive materials. Diagonal watermarks across page centers are harder to crop out than those placed in corners. Test watermark visibility on both screen and printed versions since opacity appears differently in each medium. For copyright protection, include the copyright symbol, year, and rights holder name rather than just generic \"Confidential\" text. Avoid placing watermarks over critical content areas like charts, tables, or signature lines where they might obscure important information."},"pdf-ocr":{"p2":"Upload scanned PDFs or image-based documents and the tool applies optical character recognition to detect and extract text from the visual content. Tesseract.js technology analyzes each page, identifies text regions, recognizes individual characters, and converts the image into searchable, copyable text. You can select from eight supported languages to improve recognition accuracy for non-English documents. All OCR processing runs entirely in your browser using client-side machine learning models, ensuring scanned contracts, receipts, and personal documents never upload to external servers.","p3":"Accountants extract text from scanned invoice images to copy vendor information and amounts into bookkeeping software without manual retyping. Researchers convert scanned pages from old library books into searchable text for quoting in academic papers. Legal assistants extract text from court filing image PDFs to search for specific case references and dates. Students convert photographed lecture notes into typed text for organizing digital study guides. Genealogists extract names and dates from scanned historical document images for family tree databases.","p4":"OCR accuracy improves significantly with high-contrast scans—ensure original documents are clearly legible before scanning for best text recognition results. Select the correct language setting to match your document's content, as character recognition algorithms are trained on specific language patterns. Clean scans with minimal skew and distortion work better than photos taken at angles or with shadows. Always proofread OCR output carefully, especially for numbers, dates, and proper nouns where recognition errors are common. For multi-page documents, process a single test page first to verify language settings and quality before committing to processing the entire file."},"pdf-repair":{"p2":"Upload corrupted PDFs that won't open in standard readers and the tool attempts two-stage recovery using pdf-lib and pdfjs-dist libraries. First, it tries to reconstruct the document structure and fix header corruption. If that fails, it attempts deeper recovery by extracting intact page content and rebuilding the file from recoverable elements. The success rate depends on the type and extent of corruption—complete recovery isn't always possible for severely damaged files. All repair attempts process locally in your browser, keeping potentially corrupted documents containing sensitive information private on your device.","p3":"IT professionals recover project documentation PDFs corrupted during failed disk recovery operations. Students repair thesis drafts damaged when systems crashed during saving. Archivists attempt to recover historical PDF documents degraded by bit rot on aging storage media. Legal teams recover corrupted case file PDFs before critical filing deadlines when backups aren't available. Finance departments repair damaged invoice PDFs received from vendors with transmission errors or storage issues.","p4":"Always keep original corrupted files until you verify repaired versions are complete and usable—the repair process might recover partial content but lose some pages or formatting. If initial repair fails, try converting the corrupted PDF to images first using a different tool, which might preserve visual content even if structural repair isn't possible. For important documents, consider professional data recovery services if automated repair fails, especially for legal records or irreplaceable archives. Regular backups prevent corruption disasters—this tool should be a last resort rather than a substitute for proper file management. Check that all pages, images, and formatting survived the repair process before discarding the corrupted original."},"pdf-to-pdfa":{"p2":"Upload any standard PDF and the tool converts it to PDF/A-1b format, an ISO-standardized archival variant designed for long-term preservation. The conversion embeds all fonts, images, and content directly into the file, removes external dependencies, and adds conformance metadata that archival systems recognize. PDF/A files are self-contained and don't rely on external resources that might become unavailable over time. All conversion happens in your browser, keeping archival documents containing historical records or proprietary information private on your device during the standardization process.","p3":"Corporate archivists convert business records to PDF/A format to comply with document retention regulations requiring specific preservation standards. Legal departments convert executed contracts to PDF/A for long-term storage in compliance with statute-of-limitations requirements. Government agencies convert public records to PDF/A before submitting to national archives for permanent preservation. Healthcare organizations convert patient medical records to PDF/A to meet HIPAA-compliant archival storage standards. University libraries convert digitized rare manuscripts to PDF/A format to ensure accessibility decades into the future as technology evolves.","p4":"PDF/A files are larger than standard PDFs because all fonts and resources are embedded—expect size increases of 10-30% depending on original file complexity. Some advanced PDF features like JavaScript, encryption, and multimedia don't transfer to PDF/A since they're not allowed in the archival standard. Verify converted files meet your organization's specific PDF/A compliance requirements, as variations like PDF/A-2 and PDF/A-3 have different feature sets. Use PDF/A for final archival versions rather than working documents, since the format prioritizes preservation over editability. Test that archived files open correctly in PDF/A validators to confirm conformance before committing to long-term storage."},"pdf-to-text":{"p2":"Upload a PDF and the tool extracts all text content from every page, preserving paragraph breaks but removing formatting like bold, italics, and fonts. The resulting plain text can be copied directly to your clipboard or downloaded as a TXT file for use in word processors, databases, or note-taking applications. This works best with text-based PDFs rather than scanned images, which require OCR processing first. All text extraction happens in your browser, ensuring documents containing confidential information remain private on your device during the conversion process.","p3":"Content writers extract text from PDF research materials to create quote compilations and reference notes for article drafting. Data analysts extract tables and figures from PDF reports to reformat into CSV files for database import. Students copy PDF lecture notes into study guide documents where they can add highlights and annotations. Translators extract source text from PDF documents to paste into translation software for language conversion. Developers extract configuration data or code snippets embedded in PDF technical documentation for copying into development environments.","p4":"Extracted text loses all original formatting including headings, lists, tables, and columns—what you get is a linear text stream requiring reformatting for most uses. For PDFs with complex multi-column layouts, extracted text may appear scrambled since the tool reads left-to-right without understanding column structure. Check that special characters, symbols, and non-English text transferred correctly, as some fonts may not extract properly. If you need to preserve formatting, consider PDF-to-Word conversion instead of plain text extraction. Use this tool when you only care about content, not presentation—it's ideal for feeding text into analysis tools or creating searchable archives."},"pdf-metadata":{"p2":"Upload a PDF to view embedded metadata including document title, author name, subject description, keyword tags, creation date, modification date, page count, and file size. This information is stored in the PDF header and provides context about document origin, versioning, and content. Metadata viewing is read-only—this tool displays information without modifying the file. All metadata reading happens locally in your browser, so PDFs containing proprietary information remain on your device while you inspect their properties.","p3":"Digital forensics investigators examine PDF metadata to determine when documents were created and modified during litigation discovery. Archivists check creation dates on historical document scans to organize chronological digital collections. Publishers verify author attribution and copyright dates in submitted manuscript PDFs before publication. IT security teams inspect metadata to detect potentially forged documents with suspicious creation dates or missing author information. Researchers track version history by comparing modification dates across multiple PDF drafts during collaborative writing projects.","p4":"Metadata can be incomplete or inaccurate if files were created by converters that don't populate fields properly—absence of metadata doesn't necessarily indicate tampering. Author names often reflect the computer account or PDF software license rather than the actual document creator. Creation and modification dates can be manipulated or reset during file conversion, so don't rely solely on timestamps for authentication. Some PDF generators strip metadata entirely for privacy reasons, resulting in blank or minimal information fields. If you need to edit or remove metadata for privacy before sharing files, use a dedicated metadata removal tool rather than manual editing."},"grayscale-pdf":{"p2":"Upload a color PDF and the tool converts all page content to grayscale by removing color information from images, graphics, and text. The conversion preserves document layout, fonts, and structure while transforming the color space from RGB/CMYK to grayscale values. This reduces file size and prepares documents for black-and-white printing where color would waste toner. All grayscale conversion happens locally in your browser, keeping documents containing confidential information or proprietary designs private on your device during color removal.","p3":"Students convert color textbook PDFs to grayscale before printing to avoid expensive color printing fees at campus print centers. Small businesses convert marketing materials to black-and-white for cost-effective mass printing of internal training guides. Archivists convert historical document scans to grayscale when color provides no additional informational value. Researchers prepare journal article manuscript PDFs in grayscale to comply with publisher submission requirements. Environmental groups convert color documents to grayscale to reduce printer toner consumption and extend cartridge life.","p4":"Test critical diagrams and charts after conversion to ensure important distinctions originally shown in color remain clear in grayscale—some color-coded information may become ambiguous. Grayscale conversion typically reduces file size by 30-50% for image-heavy documents since grayscale data requires less storage than full color. If your PDF contains critical color-coded content like maps or data visualizations, consider whether grayscale conversion will make the document less useful. The tool doesn't enhance contrast or adjust brightness—if scanned originals are faded, convert to grayscale first won't improve legibility. For professional printing, check whether your print service actually requires grayscale PDFs or can accept color files and handle conversion themselves."},"redact-pdf":{"p2":"Enter keywords or phrases to search throughout your PDF, then the tool highlights all matches for review before permanently blacking them out. You can redact sensitive information like social security numbers, names, account numbers, or confidential data by converting text into solid black rectangles. The redaction is permanent—text under black boxes is completely removed from the file rather than simply covered. All redaction happens locally in your browser using client-side processing, ensuring documents containing sensitive personal or business information never upload to external servers.","p3":"Legal teams redact confidential settlement amounts and trade secrets from court filings before submitting to public dockets. HR departments redact employee social security numbers and salary information from internal documents before sharing with external auditors. Healthcare providers redact patient names and medical record numbers from case studies before publishing for educational purposes. Government agencies redact classified information and personally identifiable details from Freedom of Information Act request responses. Financial institutions redact account numbers and personal details from transaction records before sharing with compliance investigators.","p4":"Always review search results carefully before applying redactions, as keyword matching may catch false positives that shouldn't be redacted. Redact more context than strictly necessary if removing isolated words might leave enough clues to deduce sensitive information from surrounding text. Test redacted PDFs by attempting to select or search under black boxes to verify text was truly removed rather than just covered. For systematic redaction of consistent patterns like social security numbers, use regex-style searches if available rather than redacting individual occurrences manually. Keep an unredacted master copy in secure storage before distributing redacted versions, as the redaction process is irreversible once the file is saved."},"extract-pdf-images":{"p2":"Upload a PDF and the tool converts each page into a high-resolution PNG image file that you can download individually or as a complete ZIP archive. Each page renders at print-quality resolution suitable for presentations, web publishing, or image editing. This differs from extracting embedded images—instead, it captures the entire page layout including text, graphics, and formatting as a complete visual snapshot. All image extraction happens in your browser, keeping documents containing proprietary designs or confidential content private on your device during the conversion process.","p3":"Designers extract presentation slides as images to insert into portfolio websites showcasing client work. Social media managers convert infographic pages into shareable image posts for Instagram and LinkedIn. Teachers extract worksheet pages as images to upload to learning management systems that don't support direct PDF embedding. Event organizers convert schedule pages into images for mobile app integration where PDF viewers aren't available. Bloggers extract diagram pages from technical PDFs to embed as illustrations in tutorial articles.","p4":"PNG format preserves text clarity and sharp edges better than JPG, though file sizes are larger—use PNG for text-heavy pages and JPG for photograph-heavy content. The tool renders pages at screen resolution by default; for print use or large displays, check if higher DPI export options are available. Extracting every page of a large document creates many files—use selective extraction if you only need specific pages rather than the entire document. Extracted images are static snapshots, so hyperlinks and interactive PDF features won't work in the image versions. If you need to edit extracted content, consider using dedicated image editing software rather than trying to modify text directly in the PNG files."},"image-converter":{"p2":"Drag any image file and the tool automatically detects its format, then lets you select JPG, PNG, or WebP as the output format. Quality sliders control compression level for JPG and WebP formats, balancing file size against visual fidelity. The converter handles diverse input formats including SVG, HEIC, AVIF, TIFF, and ICO, making it easy to transform photos from cameras, screenshots, or graphics from design tools into web-compatible formats. All conversion processing happens in your browser using client-side Canvas API, ensuring images containing personal photos or proprietary designs never upload to external servers.","p3":"Photographers convert iPhone HEIC photos to JPG for compatibility with Windows computers and older photo editing software. Web developers convert PNG screenshots with transparency to WebP for faster page loading without visual quality loss. Graphic designers convert SVG logos to high-resolution PNG for use in applications that don't support vector formats. Social media managers convert AVIF images from modern cameras to JPG for platforms that don't yet support newer formats. Bloggers convert large TIFF screenshots to compressed JPG to reduce storage requirements in content management systems.","p4":"Use PNG for images requiring transparency or sharp text/graphics with solid colors, while JPG works better for photographs where compression artifacts are less noticeable. WebP typically offers 25-35% smaller file sizes than JPG at equivalent quality levels, though older browsers may not support it. When converting to JPG, start with 85-90% quality—higher settings produce minimal visual improvement but significantly larger files. For batch conversions, test settings on one representative image first rather than processing hundreds only to find quality is too low or files too large. If converting for print, keep originals in lossless formats and only convert to compressed formats for final delivery."},"image-editor":{"p2":"Upload an image to access crop, resize, rotate, flip, brightness/contrast/saturation adjustments, and compression controls all in a unified interface. Make multiple edits in sequence without downloading and reuploading between operations—adjust brightness, then crop, then resize in one continuous workflow. The visual preview updates in real-time as you modify settings, letting you fine-tune adjustments before applying final changes. All editing happens locally in your browser using Canvas API, so personal photos, business graphics, or proprietary design files remain private on your device throughout the editing process.","p3":"Social media managers crop product photos to square aspect ratios for Instagram while adjusting brightness for optimal mobile display. Real estate agents rotate sideways property photos and enhance contrast to make room details more visible in listings. Bloggers resize header images to exact pixel dimensions required by website templates while compressing file size for faster loading. E-commerce sellers adjust saturation and lighting on product shots to ensure accurate color representation. Event photographers batch-edit brightness and crop ratios on hundreds of event photos before client delivery.","p4":"Make destructive edits like cropping and rotation first before adjusting colors, since those operations change the pixel data that color adjustments will affect. When resizing, maintain aspect ratio unless you specifically need a different shape—arbitrary resizing can distort subjects. Use incremental adjustments for brightness and saturation rather than extreme shifts, as over-processing creates unnatural appearance and posterization artifacts. Compress as the final step after all other edits are complete to avoid repeatedly compressing the same data and accumulating quality loss. Save originals separately before editing important images, since edits are permanent once you download the result."},"image-compressor":{"p2":"Upload single or multiple images and adjust quality sliders to control compression level for each format type. The tool shows before/after file sizes in real-time, helping you balance size reduction against visual quality. Batch mode processes dozens of images simultaneously with consistent compression settings, eliminating repetitive manual adjustments. All compression happens in your browser using client-side algorithms, ensuring personal photos, business graphics, or proprietary product images never upload to external servers during size reduction.","p3":"Web developers compress hero images and graphics to improve page load speed and SEO performance without redesigning layouts. E-commerce sellers batch-compress hundreds of product photos to meet marketplace file size limits while maintaining visual appeal. Bloggers compress featured images to reduce hosting storage costs and bandwidth usage. Email marketers compress newsletter graphics to ensure fast loading in email clients with aggressive image blocking. Real estate agents compress property photos to fit more images within MLS listing size restrictions.","p4":"Start with 80-85% quality for JPG compression—most viewers can't distinguish it from the original, but file sizes drop by 40-60%. PNG compression is lossless, meaning quality sliders affect file size but not visual appearance; for dramatic PNG size reduction, consider converting to JPG if transparency isn't needed. Compress copies rather than originals to preserve high-quality masters for future use cases requiring maximum resolution. Before batch-compressing hundreds of images, test settings on a few representative samples to ensure results meet your quality standards. If compressed images will be further edited or processed, use minimal compression initially to preserve quality headroom for subsequent operations."},"image-resizer":{"p2":"Upload your image and choose from preset dimensions for Instagram posts, Facebook covers, Twitter headers, or YouTube thumbnails. Alternatively, enter custom width and height values in pixels. Toggle the aspect ratio lock to maintain proportions or disable it to stretch the image to exact dimensions. The tool processes everything in your browser using canvas API, so your photos never leave your device. Download the resized image instantly as PNG or JPEG.","p3":"Content creators resize images to meet platform-specific requirements: Instagram posts need 1080×1080px squares, while Twitter headers require 1500×500px. E-commerce sellers optimize product photos to load faster on mobile devices by reducing dimensions to 800×800px or smaller. Web developers resize hero images to fit responsive layouts without distorting the composition. Graphic designers prepare assets for print by scaling mockups to exact CMYK output dimensions.","p4":"Always work with the highest resolution original you have, since resizing creates new pixels through interpolation. When reducing size dramatically, do it in steps rather than one jump to preserve detail. For social media, export at exactly the platform's recommended dimensions to avoid automatic cropping or compression. Lock aspect ratio when resizing photos to prevent distortion, but unlock it for banners or headers where stretching is intentional. Save bandwidth-heavy images as JPEG and graphics with transparency as PNG."},"image-cropper":{"p2":"Load your image and select a crop preset like 1:1 for Instagram squares, 16:9 for video thumbnails, or 4:3 for traditional photos. Drag the selection box to frame the portion you want to keep, then fine-tune by moving corners or edges. For profile pictures, switch to circle crop mode to create a round cutout. The tool renders the cropped result instantly in your browser without uploading to any server. Download the final image in PNG format with transparency preserved for circular crops.","p3":"Social media managers crop photos to fit each platform's feed ratio, turning landscape shots into 1:1 squares for Instagram or 9:16 vertical stories. Photographers reframe compositions by removing distracting edges or adjusting the focal point for different print sizes. Avatar creators use circle crop to isolate faces for Discord, Slack, or forum profiles. Product photographers crop items tightly to remove background clutter before listing on marketplaces. Thumbnail designers extract specific sections from wide screenshots to create clickable previews.","p4":"Align your subject on the rule-of-thirds intersection points before cropping for more dynamic compositions. Use the freeform tool when you need unusual ratios, but stick to presets for consistency across a photo series. Circle crop works best when the subject's face or object is centered and fills at least 60% of the circular area. Export at higher resolution than needed, then let your target platform downscale for sharper results. For print, crop to the exact paper aspect ratio to avoid awkward white borders or cuts at the print shop."},"image-to-text":{"p2":"Upload a screenshot, scanned document, or photo containing text and select the appropriate language from the six supported options. Tuttilo's OCR engine runs Tesseract.js locally in your browser, analyzing character shapes and patterns to extract readable text. The process takes a few seconds depending on image size and complexity. Once complete, copy the extracted text to your clipboard or edit it directly in the output box. No image data is sent to external servers during recognition.","p3":"Students digitize handwritten notes or textbook pages to create searchable study documents. Researchers extract data from old paper archives or scientific charts that exist only in scanned form. Translators copy foreign-language text from images into translation software when manual retyping would be time-consuming. Business professionals pull contact details from business cards captured by phone cameras. Developers extract code snippets from programming tutorial screenshots when copy-paste isn't available.","p4":"Use high-contrast images with dark text on light backgrounds for best accuracy, ideally scanned at 300 DPI or higher. Rotate or straighten skewed photos before processing, since tilted text reduces recognition rates significantly. Clean up noise, stains, or shadows in image editing software if the original is poor quality. For handwritten text, printed fonts perform far better than cursive scripts. Break large documents into smaller sections to speed up processing and isolate errors. Double-check numbers, special characters, and technical terms manually, as OCR struggles with unusual glyphs."},"meme-maker":{"p2":"Upload any image and type your text into the top and bottom caption fields. The classic white Impact font with black stroke appears automatically, mimicking the traditional meme format used across the internet since 2007. Adjust font size with the slider to fit longer or shorter phrases. Change text color if you want to break from convention or match a specific aesthetic. The tool renders captions directly onto your image using browser canvas, then lets you download the finished meme as a PNG without watermarks or branding.","p3":"Social media users create reaction memes from trending templates like \"Distracted Boyfriend\" or \"Drake Hotline Bling\" to comment on current events. Content creators add humorous captions to original photos from their lives, turning personal moments into shareable jokes. Marketing teams develop branded memes that reference industry inside jokes while promoting products in a casual tone. Community managers respond to user feedback with meme formats to humanize customer support interactions. Educators use memes to make lesson content relatable and memorable for students familiar with internet culture.","p4":"Keep top text as the setup and bottom text as the punchline for traditional meme structure. Use ALL CAPS for maximum impact, but avoid walls of text that require tiny font sizes to fit. Choose images with clear focal subjects and minimal background clutter so text remains readable. For viral potential, reference current events or trending topics within 48 hours while they're still relevant. Test different text colors against busy backgrounds to maintain contrast and legibility. Save your meme in PNG format to preserve text sharpness when shared across platforms."},"add-text-to-image":{"p2":"Upload your base image, then click to add the first text layer. Type your message, choose a font from the dropdown, pick a color using the picker, and adjust size via the slider. Position the text by dragging it anywhere on the canvas.

Real estate agents add property details, prices, and contact information directly onto listing photos. Quote creators superimpose inspirational text over scenic backgrounds for Pinterest and Instagram posts. Product designers mock up UI text on app screenshots before sending to developers.","p4":"Layer your text elements in order of importance: large headlines first, supporting details second, fine print last. Use contrasting font weights and sizes to establish visual hierarchy and guide the viewer's eye. Add a subtle shadow or outline to text placed over busy backgrounds to prevent readability issues. Stick to two or three complementary fonts maximum to avoid a cluttered, amateurish look. Align text to invisible grid lines or image elements for a polished, professional composition. Export at 2x resolution if the image will be viewed on retina displays or printed."},"compress-video":{"p2":"Load a video file from your device and select a target quality level using the slider, ranging from aggressive compression for small file sizes to minimal compression for near-original quality. The tool re-encodes your video using H.264 codec with MediaRecorder API, balancing visual fidelity against file size. Preview a short sample to evaluate the compression before processing the entire file. The encoder runs entirely in your browser, so large videos may take several minutes depending on your hardware.

Tutorial makers cut out pauses, restarts, or off-topic tangents to maintain pacing in instructional videos. Event videographers isolate specific speeches or performances from multi-hour ceremony recordings.","p4":"Leave a half-second buffer on each end of your desired clip to avoid cutting off the first or last word. Use the play preview repeatedly to confirm the trim points feel natural and don't interrupt mid-action. For social media, trim to under 60 seconds to maximize platform compatibility and viewer retention. When trimming out sensitive content, verify the excluded portion doesn't appear in thumbnail previews. Export the trimmed clip at the same resolution and frame rate as the original to avoid unnecessary re-encoding."},"video-to-gif":{"p2":"Upload a video file and use the trim handles to select the segment you want to convert, typically 2-6 seconds for optimal GIF file size. Adjust the frames per second slider to control smoothness versus file size: higher FPS creates fluid motion but larger files. Set the output width in pixels, and the height scales proportionally. Click convert and the tool extracts frames from your video, quantizes colors using a 256-color palette, and encodes the animated GIF using the gifenc library entirely in your browser. Download the finished GIF when processing completes.","p3":"Social media users convert funny video moments into looping GIFs for sharing in chats, Reddit threads, or Twitter replies where video autoplay is disabled. Designers create animated product demos or UI interactions to embed in email campaigns or landing pages. Gamers capture epic moments from gameplay recordings to share as reaction GIFs in Discord servers. Tutorial creators illustrate short how-to steps with looping GIF sequences that viewers can watch repeatedly without video controls. Meme makers transform viral video clips into portable GIF format for easier embedding across platforms.","p4":"Keep GIF duration under 5 seconds to avoid massive file sizes that fail to upload on most platforms, which cap GIFs at 15-20 MB. Reduce output width to 480-600 pixels for social media, since GIFs above 1080p become impractically large. Lower FPS to 10-15 for simple motion like text or slow movements, but use 20-24 FPS for fast action to prevent choppy playback. Trim out static frames at the beginning or end to save space and create a perfect loop. Export from the highest quality video source available, as GIFs inherit compression artifacts from their source material."},"video-to-mp3":{"p2":"Select a video file containing the audio you want to extract. The tool loads the video in your browser and separates the audio track from the visual component using media stream APIs. Processing happens locally without uploading to any server. Once extraction completes, download the audio as an MP3 file, preserving the original bitrate and sample rate when possible. The video file remains unchanged on your device. Extraction time depends on video length and your computer's processing power.","p3":"Music fans extract audio from music video downloads to build MP3 libraries for offline listening in car stereos or music players. Podcast listeners convert video podcast episodes to audio-only MP3s for smaller file sizes and compatibility with audio-focused apps. Language learners isolate dialogue tracks from foreign films to create listening comprehension practice files. DJs rip audio from performance videos to remix or sample in production software. Researchers convert lecture or interview videos to audio for easier note-taking and transcription.","p4":"Verify the video has an actual audio track before processing; screen recordings or silent clips will produce empty MP3 files. Higher bitrate source videos yield better MP3 quality, so extract from 1080p or higher when possible. For music extraction, avoid videos with introductions or outros unless you trim the video first. Use dedicated audio compression tools after extraction if the MP3 file is too large for your needs. Check the sample rate and bitrate of the extracted MP3 if you plan to edit or mix it with other audio files."},"video-converter":{"p2":"Upload a video in any supported format, then select your desired output format from the dropdown menu. Common choices include MP4 for universal compatibility, WebM for web embedding, or AVI for editing software. Click convert and the tool re-encodes your video using browser-based processing powered by MediaRecorder API. Conversion time scales with video length and resolution; a 5-minute 1080p clip may take several minutes. Download the converted file when encoding finishes, with your original file remaining intact on your device.","p3":"Video editors convert raw footage from cameras that record in proprietary formats into standard MP4 for compatibility with editing software. Web developers convert MP4 videos to WebM for smaller file sizes and better HTML5 video performance. Mobile users convert old AVI or MKV files to MP4 for playback on smartphones and tablets that don't support legacy codecs. Content archivists standardize mixed-format video libraries into a single consistent format for long-term storage. Cross-platform teams convert between formats to ensure videos play on both Mac and Windows machines.","p4":"Convert to MP4 with H.264 codec for maximum compatibility across devices, browsers, and media players. Choose WebM for web use when file size matters more than broad legacy device support. Avoid converting between lossy formats repeatedly, as each conversion degrades quality through re-compression. Keep frame rate and resolution the same as the source unless you specifically need to downscale. Test the converted file on the target device or platform before deleting the original, since codec quirks can cause unexpected playback issues."},"rotate-video":{"p2":"Upload a video that was recorded in the wrong orientation, common when filming on smartphones without rotation lock. Select the rotation angle: 90° clockwise, 90° counterclockwise, or 180° for upside-down videos. Click rotate and the tool processes the video in your browser, transposing pixel coordinates and adjusting metadata to reflect the new orientation. The output maintains the original video quality without re-encoding compression. Download the corrected video, now oriented properly for normal playback on any device.","p3":"Smartphone users fix vertical videos accidentally recorded in landscape mode or horizontal clips shot upside-down. Content creators correct footage from mounted cameras that were installed at the wrong angle. Video archivists rotate old VHS transfers that were digitized in incorrect orientation. Social media managers adjust videos to match platform requirements, rotating landscape videos to portrait for Instagram Stories. Drone pilots correct footage from cameras that tilted during flight or were mounted incorrectly before takeoff.","p4":"Check the original video metadata before rotating, as some players automatically rotate based on embedded orientation flags. Rotate only once to avoid cumulative quality loss from multiple re-encoding passes. For mobile videos, rotate to match the intended viewing orientation rather than the recording orientation. Verify the rotated video's width and height match your expectations, especially if rotating between landscape and portrait. Save the original file if you're unsure about the correct rotation, since reversing the process requires another re-encode."},"mute-video":{"p2":"Upload a video file containing audio you want to remove. The tool extracts the video stream while discarding the audio track entirely, creating a silent version using browser-based processing. No re-encoding of the visual component occurs, so video quality remains identical to the source. Processing completes in seconds for most files.

The original file stays on your device unchanged.","p3":"Social media users mute videos with copyrighted music before uploading to platforms that flag audio copyright violations. Privacy-conscious creators remove background conversations or identifying audio from footage before sharing publicly. Screen recorders strip accidental microphone audio from tutorial videos when narration wasn't intended. Video editors create silent B-roll clips for layering custom music or voiceover in editing software. Content moderators mute inappropriate or offensive audio while preserving the visual content.","p4":"Mute the video before adding new audio in editing software to avoid mixing unwanted original sound with your soundtrack. Verify the muted video actually has no audio track by checking file properties or playing at max volume. Use this tool for removing entire audio tracks; trim or cut audio tools work better for removing specific segments. For videos with multiple audio tracks, this removes all of them rather than selectively deleting one. Export the muted file and check playback before deleting the original, as some formats may behave unexpectedly without audio metadata."},"change-video-speed":{"p2":"Upload a video and select a speed multiplier from the slider: values below 1.0 slow the video down, while values above 1.0 speed it up.

Educators create audio versions of written lessons for students with visual impairments or reading difficulties. Authors listen to their drafts read aloud to catch awkward phrasing or pacing issues during editing. Language learners hear correct pronunciation of foreign words or sentences they're studying. Accessibility advocates provide audio alternatives for web content that lacks proper screen reader support.","p4":"Choose natural-sounding voices over robotic ones when available, though quality varies significantly by browser and operating system. Add punctuation like commas and periods to control pacing, since TTS engines use these cues for pauses. Spell out acronyms, numbers, and abbreviations phonetically if the voice mispronounces them. Break long text into shorter paragraphs and generate separately to avoid single enormous audio files. Test different speed and pitch combinations to find the most natural-sounding settings for your specific text and voice."},"reverse-audio":{"p2":"Upload an audio file and click the reverse button. The tool reads the audio data into memory, flips the sample order from end to beginning, and renders the reversed waveform. Processing happens entirely in your browser using Web Audio API, so files never leave your device. Preview the reversed audio to hear the backward effect. The result plays your audio in reverse chronological order, creating the classic backward-masking effect heard in experimental music and audio puzzles. Download the reversed file when ready.","p3":"Musicians create psychedelic or experimental effects by layering reversed vocals or instruments into songs. Audio engineers analyze recordings backward to detect hidden messages, edit points, or masking techniques. Sound designers generate eerie or otherworldly effects for horror films, sci-fi projects, or video games. Educators demonstrate wave properties and audio concepts by showing students how sound behaves in reverse. Puzzle creators embed backward audio clues in games or alternate reality experiences for players to decode.","p4":"Reverse your audio twice to return to the original if you need to undo the effect without re-uploading. For music, reverse specific instrument tracks rather than full mixes to create unique textures without destroying the entire arrangement. Combine reversed audio with reverb or delay effects to generate ambient soundscapes popular in lo-fi and vaporwave production. Export reversed speech to check if hidden messages exist in source material, though most \"backward masking\" claims are pareidolia. Use reversed percussion or cymbals as transitions or risers in music production, a technique common in electronic genres."},"change-audio-volume":{"p2":"Upload an audio file with volume too quiet or too loud. Use the slider to select a volume multiplier: values below 100% reduce volume, while values above increase it up to 400% for significantly quieter recordings. The tool applies gain adjustment to every sample in the waveform, processing entirely in your browser without uploading. Preview the adjusted audio to check for clipping or distortion at higher boost levels. Download the volume-adjusted file when the level sounds appropriate.","p3":"Podcasters boost quiet guest recordings to match host volume levels for consistent listening across episodes. Musicians normalize track volumes so all songs in an album or playlist play at similar perceived loudness. Phone recorders amplify distant voice memos captured from across a room or in noisy environments. Audio editors reduce overly loud sections that cause listener fatigue or speaker distortion. Content creators match background music volume to dialogue so neither element overpowers the other in video soundtracks.","p4":"Watch for clipping when boosting volume above 200%, indicated by distorted peaks or a flattened waveform at max amplitude. Normalize your audio first using editing software, then fine-tune with volume adjustment to avoid destroying dynamic range. Apply volume reduction instead of compression when you need simpler loudness control without affecting dynamics. For speech, boost to -16 dB LUFS for podcast standards or -14 dB for broadcast specs. Combine volume adjustment with EQ or noise reduction for professional results, especially on low-quality source recordings."},"word-counter":{"p2":"Type or paste your text into the input box and watch real-time statistics update automatically: total words, characters with and without spaces, sentences, and paragraphs. The tool parses your content using JavaScript string analysis, counting whitespace-delimited tokens as words and punctuation-terminated sequences as sentences. Results appear instantly without requiring any button clicks. Use the stats to verify document meets length requirements or track writing progress. All processing happens locally in your browser.","p3":"Students verify essays meet minimum word count requirements for assignments before submission to avoid grade penalties. Writers track daily word count progress toward novel, article, or blog post goals during drafting sessions. SEO specialists analyze content length to ensure pages hit target word counts for search engine ranking factors. Social media managers check character counts to stay within platform limits like Twitter's 280 characters or Facebook's post length recommendations. Translators count words in source documents to estimate project scope and calculate per-word pricing for clients.","p4":"Exclude headings, footnotes, and citations from your word count if your assignment or style guide doesn't include them. Use sentence count to identify run-on paragraphs or overly choppy writing that needs structural revision. Character count with spaces matches Microsoft Word's default, while character count without spaces matches Google Docs. For SEO, aim for 1000+ words on pillar pages and 500-800 for supporting articles to satisfy modern search algorithms. Track paragraph count to ensure content is broken into scannable sections rather than walls of text."},"lorem-ipsum":{"p2":"Select whether you want paragraphs, sentences, or individual words, then enter the quantity you need. Click generate and the tool produces classical Lorem Ipsum placeholder text derived from Cicero's \"De finibus bonorum et malorum\".

Generate repeatedly to get fresh variations. All text generation happens instantly in your browser.","p3":"Web designers fill homepage layouts, blog templates, and landing page mockups with placeholder text before real copy arrives. Graphic designers populate brochure and poster layouts to demonstrate typography and spacing to clients. UI/UX designers test how different text lengths affect responsive layouts across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports. Frontend developers verify CSS styling and font rendering using consistent dummy content before backend integration. Print designers fill magazine spreads and book layouts to present page design concepts without final manuscript text.","p4":"Use paragraph-based generation for body copy, sentence-based for headlines and callouts, and word-based for buttons or labels. Generate slightly more text than needed, then trim to fit rather than stretching short lorem ipsum awkwardly. Replace placeholder text with real copy as soon as possible, since clients sometimes forget lorem ipsum isn't final content. Avoid leaving lorem ipsum in production sites, as search engines penalize pages with nonsense text. For varied layouts, generate different quantities across sections to simulate real content's unpredictable length."},"case-converter":{"p2":"Paste your text into the input field and select the desired case format from the buttons: UPPERCASE for all caps, lowercase for no caps, Title Case for capitalized words, camelCase for variable names, PascalCase for class names, snake_case for database columns, kebab-case for URLs, or CONSTANT_CASE for environment variables. The tool applies the transformation instantly using JavaScript string manipulation, displaying the converted result below. Copy the output with one click. The conversion preserves all characters while changing only letter case and spacing.","p3":"Programmers convert variable names between coding conventions when refactoring code or migrating between languages with different style guides. Content creators fix accidentally-capslock text without retyping entire paragraphs. SEO specialists generate kebab-case slugs from article titles for clean, readable URLs. Database administrators convert table or column names to snake_case for SQL convention compliance. Copywriters transform headlines to Title Case for consistent formatting across marketing materials and social media posts.","p4":"Use camelCase and PascalCase for JavaScript variables and classes, snake_case for Python and Ruby, and kebab-case for CSS classes. CONSTANT_CASE signals global constants or environment variables in most programming languages. Avoid Title Case for technical documentation titles, which typically use sentence case instead. For URLs, prefer kebab-case over underscores, as search engines treat hyphens as word separators but not underscores. Double-check conversions that include special characters or numbers, as some converters may handle them inconsistently."},"diff-checker":{"p2":"Paste the original text into the left panel and the modified version into the right panel. Click compare and the tool runs a longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm to identify line-by-line differences. Added lines appear highlighted in green, removed lines in red, and unchanged lines in neutral gray. Line numbers display on both sides for precise reference. Scroll through the comparison to review all changes. The diff calculation happens entirely in your browser using JavaScript string analysis algorithms.","p3":"Developers compare code file versions to review changes before committing to version control systems. Writers track revisions between draft versions to see what was added, removed, or modified during editing. Translators compare source text with translated versions to verify all content was accurately converted. Contract reviewers highlight differences between agreement versions to identify altered terms or clauses. Students check their revised essays against earlier drafts to confirm all instructor feedback was addressed.","p4":"Format both texts consistently before comparing to avoid false positives from spacing or line break differences. Use line-by-line comparison for code or structured text, but consider word-level diff tools for prose. Save diff results as screenshots or copy-paste into documentation when you need to archive comparison results. For code, integrate proper version control like Git instead of manual diff checking for production workflows. Normalize whitespace, line endings, and character encoding before comparing technical files to eliminate noise from the diff output."},"markdown-editor":{"p2":"Tuttilo's Markdown editor provides a split-pane interface where you write on the left and see the rendered output on the right.

The tool preserves special characters and escapes quotes following RFC 4180 standards. All conversion logic runs locally in your browser.","p3":"Data analysts frequently convert CSV exports from databases or spreadsheets into JSON for web applications and API testing. Frontend developers use this when prototyping interfaces that will eventually fetch data from APIs, converting sample CSV datasets into JSON to mock realistic responses. Backend engineers test data transformation pipelines by verifying that their CSV imports match expected JSON structures. Researchers working with survey data export results as CSV from tools like Google Forms, then convert to JSON for custom analysis scripts.","p4":"Ensure your CSV has a header row with unique column names, or the JSON output will have duplicate keys that might break parsers. When converting JSON to CSV, flatten nested objects first since CSV is inherently two-dimensional and cannot represent hierarchies. If your CSV contains numeric values that should stay as numbers in JSON, verify the output removes quotes around digits.

The formatted result appears in a separate output box that you can copy with one click.","p3":"Programmers cleaning up list-based data files use this to remove duplicate imports or configuration entries. Writers working with transcripts apply case transformations and remove extra spacing from speech-to-text output that tends to be inconsistently formatted. System administrators sort log file entries or configuration lists alphabetically to spot outliers or compare two configs manually. Data entry clerks add prefixes like bullet points or numbering to lists before pasting into documents.","p4":"When sorting lines that contain numbers, check whether you need alphabetical or numerical sorting; '10' comes before '2' alphabetically but after it numerically. Before removing duplicates, consider whether case matters for your use case and normalize the case first if needed. Use the prefix/suffix feature to quickly wrap each line in quotation marks or array syntax when preparing data for code. Save frequently used formatting workflows as browser bookmarks with a descriptive name so you can quickly repeat multi-step transformations."},"notepad":{"p2":"Start typing in the text area and your notes automatically save to browser local storage every few seconds.

Writers draft short-form content like tweets or email replies in a distraction-free environment with automatic saving. Students working on shared computers can draft assignment text without installing software, then download it before logging out.","p4":"Treat this as a temporary scratchpad rather than long-term storage since browser data can be cleared unexpectedly by system cleanups or privacy tools. For important content, download to a file regularly rather than relying solely on local storage. If you work across multiple browsers, remember the auto-save only works within the same browser you started in.

Developers generating static HTML pages from Markdown content use this to preview how their final markup will look. Technical documentation teams verify that their Markdown files produce valid, semantic HTML before pushing to production sites.","p4":"Remember that most CMSs wrap your pasted HTML in additional div containers, so avoid adding unnecessary wrapper elements in your Markdown. Use inline HTML within your Markdown for elements that Markdown doesn't support natively, like tables or specific attributes. Test image links in both the Markdown and final HTML to ensure paths work in your target environment.

Everything processes locally in your browser.","p3":"Web developers embed small images or icons directly in CSS or HTML using data URIs, which require Base64-encoded image data. API engineers encode authentication credentials for HTTP Basic Auth headers that require base64-formatted username:password pairs. Email developers encode image attachments inline in HTML emails rather than referencing external URLs that might be blocked. Frontend engineers decode Base64 strings from APIs to extract embedded binary files like PDFs or images that were serialized for JSON transport.","p4":"Base64 increases data size by approximately 33 percent, so only use it for small files or when embedding is genuinely necessary. When encoding sensitive data like tokens or credentials, remember that Base64 is encoding, not encryption—anyone can decode it instantly. For data URIs in CSS, balance convenience against cache efficiency; external files can be cached, but data URIs are re-downloaded every time the stylesheet loads.

Teams migrating from one scheduler to another use the parser to understand legacy job timings without deciphering cryptic patterns.","p4":"Cron syntax varies slightly between implementations (Vixie cron vs. systemd timers)—verify your target system's capabilities. The fifth field is day of week, where 0 and 7 both represent Sunday—this catches many first-time users. Combining day-of-month and day-of-week uses OR logic, not AND—jobs run when either condition matches. Use */N syntax carefully; */5 in the hour field runs every 5 hours, not at 5 AM. Test cron expressions with online parsers before deploying to avoid production surprises."},"chmod-calculator":{"p2":"Toggle the read, write, and execute checkboxes for owner, group, and others to build your desired permission set. The calculator displays the octal notation (like 755 or 644) and symbolic notation (like rwxr-xr-x) in real-time. Copy the generated chmod command directly—for example, chmod 755 filename. The tool also works in reverse: paste an octal code to see which checkboxes correspond to those permissions. A reference section explains what each permission type allows for files vs. directories. All calculations happen instantly in your browser.","p3":"Linux administrators set correct permissions on web server files—755 for directories, 644 for files—to balance accessibility and security. Developers troubleshoot permission denied errors by calculating what permissions their script or user actually needs. DevOps engineers preparing deployment scripts verify that executables have the correct permission bits set. Students learning Unix file systems use the calculator to understand how octal codes translate to actual access rights.","p4":"Directories need execute permission for users to access files inside them—755 is standard for web-accessible directories. The 777 permission (read/write/execute for everyone) is a security risk; avoid it unless you're debugging a specific permission issue temporarily. Symbolic notation (chmod u+x) is safer for scripts because it doesn't overwrite existing group/other permissions. When setting permissions for SSH keys, 600 (owner read/write only) is required—more permissive settings cause authentication to fail. Use 644 for world-readable files like HTML/CSS and 600 for sensitive config files."},"http-status-codes":{"p2":"Browse the complete catalog of HTTP status codes organized by category: 1xx (informational), 2xx (success), 3xx (redirection), 4xx (client errors), and 5xx (server errors). Click any category to filter the list or use the search box to find specific codes by number or description. Each code displays its standard name, a brief explanation of when it's used, and common scenarios. The reference covers all official IANA-registered codes plus common unofficial extensions. The lookup is instant and all data is stored locally.","p3":"Backend developers reference the tool when implementing API error handling to choose semantically correct status codes. Frontend engineers debug AJAX failures by looking up unfamiliar 4xx or 5xx codes returned by servers. Technical interviewers ask candidates about specific status codes; developers use this as a quick cheat sheet. DevOps teams investigating server logs look up rare codes like 418 (I'm a teapot) or 429 (Too Many Requests) to understand what triggered them.","p4":"Use 201 Created (not 200 OK) when POST requests successfully create new resources—clients may parse the Location header differently. The 204 No Content response should have an empty body; sending content violates the spec. 301 vs. 302 matters for SEO—301 permanent redirects transfer page rank, 302 temporary redirects don't. 401 Unauthorized actually means unauthenticated (no credentials), while 403 Forbidden means authenticated but not authorized. Use 422 Unprocessable Entity for validation errors, not 400 Bad Request."},"json-to-typescript":{"p2":"Paste a JSON object or array into the input field and the tool generates a TypeScript interface matching its structure. Primitive types (string, number, boolean) are inferred from values. Objects become nested interfaces, and arrays are typed as Type[]. Optional properties are marked with ? when the field might be missing. You can customize the root interface name and choose between interface or type alias syntax. The generated TypeScript is properly formatted with indentation and ready to copy into your project. All type inference runs in your browser.","p3":"Developers integrating third-party APIs paste sample responses to generate type definitions without manually transcribing nested structures. Teams migrating JavaScript projects to TypeScript convert configuration objects to interfaces for type safety. Backend engineers share API response formats with frontend teams by providing TypeScript interfaces generated from real data. Developers working with JSON-heavy applications (like Firebase or Contentful) bootstrap type files to enable autocomplete and catch errors.","p4":"Sample data must be representative—if a field can be null or a different type, include multiple examples or manually edit the output. Arrays containing mixed types (like [1, \"two\", true]) generate union types; consider if the API actually allows this or if your sample is flawed. Optional fields (present in some responses, absent in others) require manual annotation—the tool can't infer optionality from a single example. Use const assertions for literal types when you want \"success\" rather than string. Always verify generated interfaces against actual API documentation."},"text-to-binary":{"p2":"Type or paste text into the input area and select your target format: binary (base-2), hexadecimal (base-16), octal (base-8), or decimal (UTF-8 code points). The tool converts each character to its numeric representation instantly. For binary output, each character becomes an 8-bit sequence (like 01001000 for 'H'). Hex output uses two-digit notation (48 for 'H'). Reverse conversion works too—paste binary digits and get back the original text. All encoding happens client-side in your browser.","p3":"Computer science students learning about character encoding convert strings to binary to understand how text is stored in memory. Network engineers troubleshoot protocol issues by examining hex dumps of packet data. Developers implementing custom serialization formats convert strings to numeric representations for compact storage. Cryptography enthusiasts analyze bit patterns in text before applying encryption algorithms.","p4":"UTF-8 encoding means multi-byte characters (like emoji) produce longer binary sequences than ASCII characters. Binary output can be space-separated or continuous—choose based on whether you need to parse it programmatically or read it visually. Hexadecimal is the most compact human-readable format; use it for displaying raw byte data. When converting binary back to text, ensure proper byte alignment—each character needs exactly 8 bits. Non-printable characters may not render visibly in the text output; check code points to verify conversion accuracy."},"url-parser":{"p2":"Paste a full URL into the input field and the parser breaks it into labeled components: protocol (http/https), hostname, port (if specified), pathname, query parameters (as key-value pairs), and hash fragment. Each component is displayed separately for easy reading. Query parameters are parsed into individual fields with clear separation of keys and values. The tool handles complex URLs with special characters, encoded entities, and multiple parameters. URL parsing occurs entirely in your browser using native browser APIs.","p3":"Web developers debug routing issues by parsing URLs to verify which path and parameters are actually being sent. QA engineers extract query parameters from failing requests to reproduce bugs with exact inputs. SEO specialists analyze URL structure to ensure clean, readable paths for search engines. Security researchers examine URLs from phishing attempts to identify suspicious domains or encoded payloads hidden in parameters.","p4":"Port numbers are often implicit—80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS—and won't appear unless explicitly specified in the URL. Query parameter order doesn't affect functionality but may matter for caching or server-side logic. URL encoding (%20 for spaces) is decoded automatically; if you need raw encoded values, check the original URL string. Hash fragments (#section) aren't sent to the server—they're processed client-side only. When testing APIs, verify that special characters in parameters are properly encoded (& within values should be %26)."},"color-converter":{"p2":"Choose a color using the visual picker or paste a HEX, RGB, HSL, HWB, or CMYK value into any input field. The tool instantly calculates and displays equivalent values in all supported formats. HEX values can include 3-digit shorthand (#fff) or 6-digit full notation (#ffffff). RGB supports both comma-separated (255, 0, 0) and functional (rgb(255, 0, 0)) syntax. HSL, HWB, and CMYK formats are similarly flexible. Alpha transparency is preserved across conversions where supported. All color math runs locally in your browser.","p3":"Designers converting brand colors from print (CMYK) to web (HEX/RGB) for consistent cross-medium branding. Frontend developers translating design mockup colors into CSS values for implementation. Developers debugging color inconsistencies verify that designer-provided colors match what's rendered. Accessibility specialists convert colors to HSL to adjust lightness values for WCAG contrast ratio compliance.","p4":"CMYK values don't map perfectly to RGB—expect slight hue shifts when converting print colors to screen. Use HSL when you need to create color variations (lighter, darker, more saturated) by adjusting single parameters. HWB (Hue-Whiteness-Blackness) is underutilized but excellent for generating tints and shades programmatically. Alpha transparency (rgba, hsla) isn't supported in HEX format without 8-digit notation (#rrggbbaa), which isn't universally supported. Always verify converted colors visually; mathematical equivalence doesn't guarantee perceptual matching across devices."},"slug-generator":{"p2":"Type or paste text into the input area and the tool converts it to a URL-friendly slug in real-time. Special characters, punctuation, and accents are removed or transliterated to ASCII equivalents. Spaces are replaced with your chosen separator (hyphen by default, underscore optional). Multiple consecutive spaces or separators are collapsed to a single separator. Leading and trailing separators are stripped. The output is lowercase by default (configurable). All slug generation happens instantly in your browser.","p3":"Bloggers convert article titles to URL slugs for SEO-friendly permalinks. E-commerce developers generate product URLs from product names with special characters or accents. CMS developers automatically create route-safe identifiers from user-input page titles. Developers building file upload systems sanitize filenames by converting them to slugs before storage.","p4":"Keep slugs short and meaningful—overly long URLs hurt user experience and may be truncated in search results. Remove stop words (like, the, a, and) manually for cleaner slugs, as most generators preserve them. Accented characters should transliterate (é → e), not vanish—verify your slug generator handles your language properly. Avoid underscores in URLs if you need Google to treat words separately; hyphens are preferred. Always generate slugs programmatically during content creation; don't let users type them manually without validation."},"word-frequency":{"p2":"Paste text into the input area and the analyzer counts every word's occurrence. Results are displayed in descending order by frequency, showing count and percentage of total words. Each word gets a visual bar representing its relative frequency. You can filter out common stop words (the, a, is) to focus on meaningful content words. Case sensitivity is optional—enable it to treat \"Word\" and \"word\" as distinct. Minimum word length filters remove short words like \"I\" or \"a\". Analysis runs entirely in your browser.","p3":"Content writers analyze keyword density in articles to optimize SEO without over-stuffing. Students studying literature identify recurring themes by finding the most frequent meaningful words. Customer service teams analyze support ticket text to identify common complaint topics. Social media managers evaluate brand mentions and sentiment by examining word frequency in collected comments or reviews.","p4":"Enable stop word filtering to surface meaningful patterns—\"the\" appearing 500 times tells you nothing useful. Case-insensitive mode is usually better for semantic analysis; case-sensitive matters only when distinguishing proper nouns. Set a minimum word length (3-4 characters) to exclude articles and prepositions that inflate counts. Combine word frequency with context—high frequency of \"not\" or \"no\" might indicate negative sentiment. Export the frequency list for further analysis in spreadsheet tools or data visualization software."},"text-reverser":{"p2":"Paste text into the input area and choose your reversal mode: by character (entire string backwards), by word (words in reverse order but characters normal), or by line (lines in reverse order). Click Reverse and the transformed text appears immediately. Character reversal produces mirror text (Hello → olleH). Word reversal reorders words while preserving spelling (Hello World → World Hello). Line reversal is useful for log files or lists. All three modes preserve original spacing and punctuation behavior. Processing is instant and client-side.","p3":"Developers test string manipulation functions by providing reversed input as edge cases. Puzzle creators generate reversed text for riddles or cryptographic challenges. Educators create dyslexia awareness exercises by showing text in reversed character order. Data entry workers reverse accidentally copied text that was pasted in the wrong direction (happens with right-to-left languages).","p4":"Character reversal breaks multi-byte Unicode characters like emoji—verify output manually if your text contains non-ASCII symbols. Word reversal depends on whitespace as delimiters; punctuation attached to words moves with them. Line reversal is perfect for analyzing stack traces or logs where the most recent entries are last. Use word reversal to create language-learning exercises where students reconstruct sentence order. Reversing already-reversed text should return the original—if it doesn't, encoding issues are present."},"duplicate-remover":{"p2":"Paste line-based text into the input area and click Remove Duplicates. The tool scans all lines, keeps the first occurrence of each unique line, and removes all subsequent duplicates. Case sensitivity is optional—disable it to treat \"hello\" and \"Hello\" as duplicates. The trim whitespace option removes leading/trailing spaces before comparison, so \" hello\" and \"hello \" are considered identical. Empty lines can be preserved or removed. Results show how many duplicates were eliminated. Processing is instant and entirely local.","p3":"Data analysts clean CSV files by removing duplicate rows before importing into databases. Developers deduplicate lists of URLs, email addresses, or IDs collected from multiple sources. SEO specialists clean keyword lists by removing repetitions before importing to tools. System administrators merge log files and remove duplicate entries to reduce file size and noise.","p4":"Always preserve the original file before deduplication—if line order matters semantically, duplicate removal may break logic. Enable case-insensitive mode when working with user-submitted data (emails, names) where inconsistent capitalization is common. Whitespace trimming is essential for real-world data—users often add accidental spaces that create false uniques. Empty line preservation depends on context: keep them in formatted text, remove them in data lists. Verify the first vs. last occurrence behavior—some tools keep the last, which matters for timestamped data."},"text-sorter":{"p2":"Paste lines of text into the input area and choose a sort method: alphabetical (A-Z), reverse alphabetical (Z-A), by line length (shortest first), numeric (interprets lines as numbers), or random (shuffle). Click Sort and the rearranged text appears instantly. Alphabetical sort is case-insensitive by default but can be made case-sensitive. Numeric sort treats lines as numbers, sorting 10 after 2 (unlike alphabetical, which sorts 10 before 2). Random sort shuffles lines unpredictably. All sorting happens client-side in your browser.","p3":"Developers organize import statements alphabetically for cleaner code. Writers arrange list items by length to create visually balanced layouts. Database administrators sort column names alphabetically when documenting schemas. Teachers randomize student name lists for selecting volunteers or forming groups. Data analysts sort numeric IDs to identify gaps or duplicates in sequences.","p4":"Numeric sort only works when each line is purely numeric—mixed alphanumeric lines will produce unexpected results. Use case-sensitive alphabetical sorting when working with programming identifiers where case distinguishes meaning. Random sort is useful for creating unbiased sample datasets, but it's not cryptographically secure. Length-based sorting creates aesthetic effects in design; shortest-to-longest flows well visually. Always preview sorted output before using it—sorting can break semantic relationships between lines (like paired data)."},"unicode-lookup":{"p2":"Type or paste any character into the input field and the tool displays its Unicode properties: official name, code point (U+XXXX), hexadecimal value, UTF-8 byte sequence, UTF-16 encoding, and HTML entity (both decimal &#N; and named &entity; if available). Properties also include the Unicode block (Latin, CJK, Emoji, etc.) and character category. For multi-character input, each character is analyzed separately. The lookup is instant and uses browser-native Unicode data.","p3":"Developers troubleshoot encoding issues by identifying which character caused UTF-8 decode errors in logs. Technical writers find HTML entities for special symbols like copyright ©, trademark ™, or currency symbols. Linguists analyze text samples to identify script systems and character sets. Security researchers detect homograph attacks by inspecting visually similar characters from different Unicode blocks (like Cyrillic o vs. Latin o).","p4":"Code points above U+FFFF require surrogate pairs in UTF-16—emoji and rare CJK characters fall into this range. HTML named entities exist only for common symbols; use decimal/hex entities for comprehensive coverage. UTF-8 byte length varies (1-4 bytes per character)—this matters for byte-based string length limits in databases or protocols. Zero-width characters (U+200B, U+FEFF) won't display visibly but affect text processing. Check the character category (Letter, Symbol, Punctuation) to understand why certain characters behave unexpectedly in regex or sorting."},"invisible-char-detector":{"p2":"Paste text into the input field and the detector highlights all invisible, non-printable, and zero-width characters. Detected characters include zero-width spaces (U+200B), zero-width non-joiners, zero-width joiners, byte order marks (BOM), soft hyphens, and other Unicode control characters. Each occurrence is marked in the text with a colored indicator and labeled with its Unicode code point and name. A summary shows the total count of each invisible character type. Detection runs entirely in your browser.","p3":"Developers debug copy-paste errors where code looks correct but won't compile due to hidden Unicode characters. Web designers investigate layout issues caused by zero-width spaces breaking word wrapping. Data analysts clean datasets where invisible characters contaminate string fields, breaking joins or comparisons. Security teams detect obfuscated phishing URLs where zero-width characters hide the real domain.","p4":"Zero-width spaces (ZWSP) are the most common culprit—they appear when copying from PDFs or web pages with specific rendering. Byte Order Marks (BOM) at file starts can break parsers expecting plain UTF-8. Soft hyphens (U+00AD) are legitimate in typesetting but cause problems in code or data fields. Right-to-left marks (RLM/LRM) affect text direction rendering; they're invisible but semantically important. Use regex /[​-‏﻿]/g to programmatically strip common invisible characters after detection."},"random-string-generator":{"p2":"Set the desired string length using the slider or number input. Toggle character set options: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Choose how many random strings to generate in one batch. Click Generate and cryptographically secure random strings appear instantly. Each string is independent and unpredictable. Copy individual strings or copy all at once. For maximum security, the tool uses crypto.getRandomValues() rather than Math.random(). All generation happens in your browser without server requests.","p3":"Developers generate secure API keys, tokens, or session identifiers for authentication systems. System administrators create temporary passwords for new user accounts that require manual password change on first login. QA engineers generate random test data for stress testing input validation. Database designers create sample unique identifiers when prototyping schema with synthetic data.","p4":"Cryptographic randomness matters—never use Math.random() for security-sensitive strings. Length is more important than character set complexity; a 20-character alphanumeric string is stronger than a 10-character string with symbols. Avoid ambiguous characters (0/O, 1/l/I) in user-facing strings to reduce support burden. Store generated secrets securely; regenerating identical strings is statistically impossible. For passwords, prioritize length over complexity—four random words beat a complex 8-character string. Use base64 encoding for API tokens to ensure URL-safe characters."},"meta-tag-generator":{"p2":"Start by entering your website's core information: page title, concise description, and relevant keywords. The tool generates complete HTML meta tags covering standard SEO elements, Open Graph properties for social sharing, and Twitter Card markup. All processing happens directly in your browser, so your website details remain private. Preview the generated tags and copy the ready-to-use HTML code to paste into your page's <head> section. Adjust settings like image URLs and content types to match your specific needs.","p3":"Web developers launching new sites use this to ensure proper social media previews from day one. Marketing teams running multiple landing pages streamline their workflow by quickly generating consistent meta tags across campaigns. Bloggers optimize each article for search engines and social platforms without manually writing repetitive HTML. E-commerce sites ensure product pages display correctly when shared on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, maximizing click-through potential.","p4":"Keep your title tag under 60 characters to avoid truncation in search results, while descriptions should aim for 150-160 characters. Include your primary keyword near the beginning of both fields for better SEO performance. For Open Graph images, use dimensions of at least 1200x630 pixels to ensure sharp previews across all platforms. Test your generated tags using Facebook's Sharing Debugger and Twitter's Card Validator before publishing to catch any issues early.","p5":"Yes, this generator creates tags that work perfectly for WordPress, Shopify, Wix, custom HTML sites, and any CMS. The code is standard HTML that fits anywhere in your page's head section."},"open-graph-generator":{"p2":"Input your page title, description, and main image URL to generate complete Open Graph meta tags. The tool creates tags for type classification (website, article, product), site name, and locale settings. Tuttilo processes everything client-side, so your content details never leave your device. The generated markup follows Facebook's Open Graph protocol specification exactly. Copy the resulting meta tags and insert them in your HTML head section to control how links appear when shared across social networks.","p3":"Content creators sharing articles on Facebook need proper previews to drive engagement and clicks. E-commerce businesses ensure product images and descriptions display correctly when customers share items with friends. News websites control how headlines and featured images appear in social feeds to maintain brand consistency. Portfolio sites showcasing work need compelling previews that encourage potential clients to click through and explore further.","p4":"Use absolute URLs for all image sources—relative paths won't work when social platforms crawl your page. Your og:image should be at minimum 600x315 pixels, but 1200x630 is optimal for high-resolution displays. Include og:type that accurately reflects your content, whether it's an article, website, or product. After implementation, clear Facebook's cache by pasting your URL into their Sharing Debugger to see the updated preview immediately rather than waiting for automatic refresh.","p5":"Absolutely. Open Graph tags are recognized by Facebook, LinkedIn, Discord, Slack, Pinterest, and many other platforms. Twitter also reads OG tags as fallback when Twitter Card tags aren't present."},"robots-txt-generator":{"p2":"Select which user agents to configure, starting with the wildcard (*) that applies to all crawlers or specific bots like Googlebot and Bingbot. Define allowed and disallowed paths using URL patterns, add crawl delays if needed, and specify your sitemap location. The generator creates a properly formatted robots.txt file following standard protocol syntax. Everything runs in your browser with no server uploads. Download the finished file and upload it to your website's root directory for search engines to discover.","p3":"Website administrators prevent search engines from indexing duplicate content in staging or development directories. E-commerce sites block crawlers from accessing internal search result pages that create infinite URL variations. Content sites protect admin areas and private sections while allowing public pages to be indexed freely. SEO specialists set crawl rate limits on large sites to prevent server overload from aggressive bot traffic.","p4":"Place your robots.txt file only in the root domain directory—subdirectories are ignored by crawlers. Use specific disallow rules rather than blocking entire sections when possible to maintain granular control. Test your robots.txt file with Google Search Console's robots.txt Tester before deploying to catch syntax errors. Remember that robots.txt is advisory, not security—malicious bots may ignore it, so never rely on it to protect sensitive data. Include your XML sitemap URL to help search engines discover all your important pages efficiently.","p5":"While most major search engines respect robots.txt directives, it's not enforceable. Reputable crawlers follow the rules, but malicious bots often ignore them. Never use robots.txt for security—protect sensitive areas with proper authentication instead."},"sitemap-generator":{"p2":"Enter your website's URLs one per line or paste an entire list of pages you want indexed. Set the change frequency (daily, weekly, monthly) and priority values for each URL to guide search engine crawlers. The tool generates valid XML sitemap format that complies with sitemaps.org protocol standards. Processing happens locally in your browser for complete privacy. Download the generated sitemap.xml file and upload it to your website's root directory, then submit the URL to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools.","p3":"New website launches benefit from sitemaps that help search engines discover all pages immediately rather than waiting for natural crawling. Large e-commerce sites with thousands of product pages ensure nothing gets missed during indexing. Blog platforms with deep archives make older content accessible to search bots that might not crawl past recent posts. Multi-language sites submit separate sitemaps for each language version to improve international SEO performance.","p4":"Split large sites into multiple sitemap files if you exceed 50,000 URLs or 50MB uncompressed size limits. Use a sitemap index file to reference multiple sitemaps on big sites. Set higher priority values (0.8-1.0) for your most important pages like homepage and key landing pages, while giving lower priority (0.3-0.5) to tags and archives. Update your sitemap whenever you add significant new content and resubmit to search consoles. Include only canonical URLs to avoid confusing search engines with duplicate content across URL variations.","p5":"Google, Bing, Yahoo, Yandex, and virtually all modern search engines support XML sitemaps. Some engines also support sitemap index files, image sitemaps, and video sitemaps for specialized content."},"keyword-density-analyzer":{"p2":"Paste your content into the text area and click analyze to see detailed keyword statistics. The tool counts total words, character length, and generates frequency tables for single words, two-word phrases (bigrams), and three-word phrases (trigrams). Each keyword shows its occurrence count and density percentage calculated against total word count. Analysis runs entirely in your browser, keeping your content private. Use the results to identify overused terms, spot keyword stuffing issues, and optimize your content's natural flow.","p3":"SEO writers check their articles to ensure target keywords appear at optimal density without crossing into spam territory. Content marketers analyze competitor articles to understand which terms they emphasize for ranking success. Blog editors review submissions to maintain consistent keyword usage across multiple authors. PPC specialists optimize landing page copy to align with ad campaign keywords while keeping the text readable and persuasive.","p4":"Aim for keyword density between 1-2% for primary keywords—higher percentages risk triggering spam filters. Focus more on semantic relevance and related terms rather than exact-match repetition. Pay attention to bigrams and trigrams since search engines increasingly favor natural phrases over single-word stuffing. Use synonyms and variations of your target keyword to create topical depth without repetitive phrasing. Check your headings separately since they carry more SEO weight than body text and should naturally incorporate key terms.","p5":"Keyword density alone doesn't determine rankings anymore. Modern search algorithms value content quality, user intent, semantic relationships, and natural language patterns. Use density analysis as one diagnostic tool among many for content optimization."},"serp-preview":{"p2":"Enter your page title, meta description, and URL slug to see an exact replica of how your listing will appear in Google's search results. The preview updates in real-time as you type, showing pixel-accurate character limits for both title and description. Color-coded indicators warn when you've exceeded the display thresholds where Google truncates text. All rendering happens in your browser with zero data sent to servers. Adjust your copy until the preview looks compelling and fits within Google's display constraints perfectly.","p3":"Digital marketers craft title tags that maximize click-through rates by testing different versions before publishing. E-commerce managers preview product page listings to ensure pricing and benefits appear clearly in search results. Bloggers optimize article titles and descriptions to stand out in crowded search pages for their target topics. SEO agencies show clients exactly how their pages will look in search results before launching optimization campaigns.","p4":"Front-load your title with the most compelling benefit or keyword since truncation often cuts the end. Use power words like 'free,' 'guide,' 'ultimate,' or '2026' to boost click appeal within your character budget. Include a clear call-to-action or benefit statement in your description's first 120 characters since mobile results show less text. Test your page title with different year markers or numbers to see which version creates the strongest visual impact. Avoid excessive punctuation or ALL CAPS that make listings look spammy regardless of character count.","p5":"While this preview is based on desktop Google search layout, actual results can vary. Google may rewrite titles and descriptions based on the search query, and mobile displays show fewer characters. Use this as a baseline guideline."},"schema-markup-generator":{"p2":"Choose from multiple schema types including Article, Product, Recipe, Event, Organization, and LocalBusiness. Fill in the relevant fields for your selected schema type—required properties are clearly marked. The tool generates clean JSON-LD structured data that search engines can easily parse. All processing occurs locally in Tuttilo, protecting your business information. Copy the generated JSON-LD code and paste it into a script tag in your HTML head or body section to enable rich snippets in search results.","p3":"Local businesses add LocalBusiness schema to appear in map packs with hours, phone numbers, and reviews prominently displayed. Recipe bloggers implement Recipe schema to show cooking time, ratings, and calorie counts directly in search results. E-commerce sites use Product schema to display prices, availability, and star ratings in Google Shopping results. Event organizers ensure their concerts and conferences appear with dates, venues, and ticket links in specialized event search features.","p4":"Validate your generated schema using Google's Rich Results Test before deploying to catch errors that could prevent rich snippets. Use Organization schema on your homepage to establish your brand identity across Google's knowledge graph. Combine multiple schema types on a single page when appropriate—a recipe blog post can include both Article and Recipe markup. Keep your schema data synchronized with visible page content since mismatches can trigger manual penalties. Update schema when page content changes, particularly for time-sensitive fields like event dates or product prices.","p5":"Yes, JSON-LD is Google's recommended structured data format. It's cleaner than microdata or RDFa alternatives because it keeps markup separate from HTML content, making it easier to manage and less likely to break during site updates."},"readability-score":{"p2":"Paste your text into the analyzer and receive instant readability scores from six different algorithms: Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index, SMOG, Coleman-Liau, and Automated Readability Index. Each score includes interpretation guidelines explaining what the numbers mean for your audience. The tool counts sentences, words, syllables, and complex words to calculate precise metrics. Processing happens entirely in your browser, so your content stays private. Use the multi-algorithm approach to get a comprehensive understanding of your text's accessibility across different measurement standards.","p3":"Content writers targeting general audiences aim for 8th-grade reading level to maximize comprehension across demographics. Technical writers check documentation to ensure it matches their audience's expertise without being condescending or overly complex. Marketing teams test landing page copy to confirm it's accessible to their target customer base. Academic editors verify that research summaries achieve appropriate simplicity for journal submission requirements while maintaining accuracy.","p4":"Break long sentences into shorter ones to quickly improve most readability scores without changing your message. Replace multi-syllable words with simpler alternatives when they don't sacrifice meaning or precision. Use active voice instead of passive constructions to reduce word count and improve clarity. Mix sentence lengths to create rhythm that engages readers even at lower grade levels. Remember that some topics inherently require complex terminology—aim for appropriate readability rather than the lowest possible score when writing for specialized audiences.","p5":"Lower scores indicate harder reading, higher scores mean easier reading. Flesch Reading Ease ranges from 0-100 (higher is easier). Most other scores indicate grade level—for example, a score of 9 means 9th-grade reading level."},"timezone-converter":{"p2":"Select your source timezone from the comprehensive dropdown list organized by regions and cities worldwide. Enter or select the time you want to convert using the time picker. Choose your target timezone from the same geographic list. The conversion happens instantly with full date and time details displayed for both locations.

The tool accounts for daylight saving time automatically based on the current date, ensuring conversions remain accurate year-round.","p3":"Remote teams coordinate meeting times across continents by converting everyone's local hours to find overlapping work periods. International travelers planning trips check what time they'll arrive at their destination to arrange pickups and reservations. Stock market traders monitor opening and closing times for exchanges in different timezone locations. Podcast listeners in Europe calculate when their favorite US-based shows go live in their local evening hours.","p4":"Bookmark converters for your frequently used timezone pairs to save repetition on regular calls. Remember that timezone abbreviations like PST or EST can be ambiguous—always select by city name to ensure accuracy. Double-check conversions during daylight saving transition periods in March and November when rules differ between regions. Use UTC as an intermediate reference when coordinating across three or more timezones to reduce conversion errors.

Fitness enthusiasts track rest intervals between workout sets or run timed HIIT training sessions. Presenters rehearse speeches within strict time limits to ensure they fit allocated conference slots without running over.","p4":"Keep the browser tab visible or at least unmuted to hear the alarm when time expires—many browsers pause background tab timers. Add a 30-second buffer to critical timings like cooking to account for your reaction time when the alarm sounds. Use multiple browser windows with different timers for complex workflows requiring overlapping time tracking. For long durations over an hour, verify your computer won't go to sleep and pause the countdown. Write down your timer settings before closing the browser if you need to recreate the same interval later.","p5":"Browser behavior varies. Some browsers throttle or pause timers in background tabs to save resources. For best reliability, keep the timer tab active or use multiple windows instead of tabs for simultaneous timers."},"stopwatch":{"p2":"Click the start button to begin timing with precision down to centiseconds (hundredths of a second). The display shows minutes, seconds, and centiseconds updating in real-time. Hit the lap button during running timing to record split times without stopping the overall counter. All splits are saved in a list showing both individual lap duration and cumulative total time. Stop the timer when finished, and reset to clear all data and return to zero. Tuttilo runs the stopwatch entirely in your browser using high-precision performance timing APIs.","p3":"Track runners record split times for each lap during training runs to analyze pace consistency and identify improvement areas. Competitive gamers time speedrun attempts with lap markers for each level or checkpoint completion. Scientists measure reaction times in experiments requiring precise timing measurements below one-second resolution. Cooking enthusiasts time multiple dishes simultaneously using lap markers to coordinate complex meal preparations with perfect synchronization.","p4":"Use the lap function proactively to capture timestamps even if you think you might not need them—you can always ignore extra data later. For very precise measurements, minimize other browser activity to reduce timing interference from resource-intensive tabs. Record your initial reaction time by testing how quickly you can hit the stop button after start to account for human delay in other measurements. Review lap times immediately after stopping since some browsers may clear data if you navigate away from the page without noting results.","p5":"Yes, the stopwatch uses JavaScript's performance.now() API which provides microsecond precision. However, display is limited to centiseconds (10ms) for practical readability. Actual precision depends on your device's performance characteristics."},"date-calculator":{"p2":"Choose between two calculation modes: finding the difference between two specific dates, or adding/subtracting a time period from a starting date. For difference calculations, select both start and end dates using the calendar pickers. For addition/subtraction, choose your base date and specify how many years, months, weeks, or days to add or remove. The calculator displays detailed results showing total time in years, months, weeks, days, hours, and minutes. All computation happens in your browser with no external requests. The tool handles leap years, month-length variations, and daylight saving transitions automatically.","p3":"Project managers calculate exact durations between milestone dates to create accurate timeline estimates and deadline tracking. Pregnant individuals count days until their due date while tracking weeks completed for medical appointments. Legal professionals compute statute of limitations periods, filing deadlines, and compliance timeframes with precision. Event planners determine how many weeks remain before conferences to schedule preparation tasks and vendor deadlines appropriately.","p4":"When adding months to a date, remember that results depend on day-of-month handling—adding one month to January 31st gives you February 28th (or 29th), not March 3rd. For business day calculations, manually subtract weekends and holidays since standard date math counts all calendar days. Use the detailed breakdown to choose the most appropriate unit—90 days sounds more urgent than 3 months in project communications. Verify timezone assumptions when calculating across geographic boundaries to avoid off-by-one errors at midnight boundaries.","p5":"Yes, the calculator automatically accounts for leap years when calculating date ranges or adding/subtracting years. February 29th is correctly handled in all calculations involving leap year dates."},"week-number":{"p2":"Select any date using the calendar picker to instantly see its ISO week number along with additional temporal information. The display shows which week of the year it is (1-53), the day number within that year (1-366), how many days remain until year end, which fiscal quarter it falls in, and the day of the week name. All calculations follow the ISO 8601 standard where weeks start on Monday and the first week contains January 4th. Tuttilo processes the date locally in your browser using standard date calculation methods.","p3":"Manufacturing facilities schedule production runs using ISO week numbers to align with supplier shipment calendars and avoid confusion across international teams. Project managers working with European clients adopt ISO week numbering to match their scheduling conventions accurately. Retail analysts aggregate sales data by calendar week rather than month to spot trends independent of varying month lengths. Software release cycles planned on weekly sprints reference ISO weeks for clear communication across global development teams.","p4":"Remember that ISO weeks can span two calendar years—week 1 of 2026 might include days from late December 2025. Some years have 53 weeks instead of the usual 52, occurring when January 1st falls on a Thursday or leap years where it falls on Wednesday. Use consistent week numbering systems within your organization to avoid confusion between ISO and US conventions where weeks start Sunday. Export data with both week number and year to prevent ambiguity in historical records spanning multiple years.","p5":"ISO weeks start on Monday, with week 1 being the first week containing a Thursday (which ensures it contains January 4th). US convention starts weeks on Sunday, and week 1 is simply the first week of January. This tool uses ISO 8601 standard."},"world-clock":{"p2":"The clock displays current time for major cities across all inhabited continents, updating every second in real-time. Each city shows its timezone name, current hour in 24-hour format, and date. The interface groups cities by continent for easy scanning of regional times. Add or remove cities using the customization controls to focus on locations relevant to your needs. Everything runs in your browser using your device's system clock and timezone database. The clock continues running accurately even without internet connection after initial page load.","p3":"Global customer support teams staff their overnight shifts based on peak hours in key markets displayed on the world clock. Stock market traders watch for exchange opening times in Tokyo, London, and New York to capitalize on market-moving events. Remote workers in different continents check what time it is for colleagues before sending messages or scheduling impromptu calls. International families coordinate video calls with relatives abroad by finding times that work across multiple timezone locations simultaneously.","p4":"Set the world clock as your browser's default new tab page to always have instant timezone awareness when opening your browser. Use the 24-hour format to avoid AM/PM confusion when calculating working hours across the international date line. Note which cities are currently in daylight saving time by checking for one-hour shifts from their standard offset. For critical time-sensitive coordination, confirm the other party's actual local time rather than assuming based on their city, as rural areas sometimes differ from major urban centers.","p5":"Yes, the clock uses your browser's date/time API which updates continuously. However, accuracy depends on your device's system clock being set correctly. If your system time is wrong, all displayed times will be offset accordingly."},"pomodoro-timer":{"p2":"Start a work session with the default 25-minute focus period, during which the timer counts down while you concentrate on a single task. When the work interval completes, a notification alerts you to take a 5-minute break. After completing four work sessions, the tool automatically schedules a longer 15-minute break to prevent burnout. Track your completed pomodoros in the session counter to measure daily productivity. The timer runs entirely in your browser with optional sound notifications. Pause, skip, or reset the session anytime to adapt the technique to your actual workflow interruptions.","p3":"Software developers maintain deep focus during complex coding sessions while ensuring regular breaks to prevent mental fatigue. Writers tackle article drafts in structured intervals that balance creative flow with necessary rest periods. Students prepare for exams using timed study blocks that maximize information retention through spaced practice. Freelancers track billable hours and maintain work-life boundaries by committing to specific numbers of pomodoros per client project daily.","p4":"During your 25-minute work session, close all communication apps and browser tabs unrelated to your current task to protect your focus. Use the 5-minute breaks for physical movement rather than screen time to genuinely rest your eyes and mind. Adjust the default timing if 25 minutes proves too long or short for your attention span, though research suggests this duration optimizes focus for most people. Start tracking which types of tasks fit cleanly into single pomodoros versus requiring multiple sessions to inform better time estimates. Don't interrupt a running pomodoro for minor distractions—note them down to address during the next break instead.","p5":"The Pomodoro Technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. He used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer (pomodoro is Italian for tomato), which gave the productivity method its distinctive name."},"epoch-converter":{"p2":"Enter a Unix timestamp in seconds or milliseconds format to see the corresponding human-readable date and time in your local timezone. Alternatively, select a specific date and time using the calendar picker to convert it into Unix epoch format. The current epoch timestamp is displayed prominently and updates every second for reference. Both UTC and local timezone conversions are shown simultaneously to help with debugging timezone-related issues. Tuttilo performs all conversions in your browser using JavaScript's built-in date handling. Toggle between seconds and milliseconds based on which format your application uses.","p3":"Software developers debug timestamp storage issues by converting database values into readable dates to verify data accuracy. API testers validate webhook payloads containing Unix timestamps by confirming the dates match expected event timing. System administrators investigate server logs containing epoch timestamps to correlate events across different timezone configurations. Data analysts import CSV files with epoch timestamps and convert them to standard dates for spreadsheet analysis and reporting.","p4":"Remember that Unix timestamps are always in UTC, so account for timezone offsets when comparing to local times. Some systems use seconds since epoch while others use milliseconds—a 13-digit timestamp likely uses milliseconds, 10 digits uses seconds. Avoid storing dates before January 1, 1970, or after January 19, 2038, if your system uses 32-bit signed integers for epoch values. Use the converter to test edge cases like midnight, daylight saving transitions, and leap seconds when building date-handling code. For very precise timing, note that leap seconds aren't included in Unix time, which can matter for astronomical or scientific calculations.","p5":"Yes, many languages and databases store epoch time as 32-bit signed integers, which will overflow on January 19, 2038, at 03:14:07 UTC. This 'Y2K38' problem affects older systems that haven't migrated to 64-bit timestamps."},"twitter-card-preview":{"p2":"Fill in your content's title, description, image URL, and choose between summary or summary with large image card types. The preview renders exactly how your link will appear when shared on Twitter (X), showing character truncation and image dimensions in real-time. The tool generates the complete set of Twitter Card meta tags needed in your HTML head section. All rendering happens in Tuttilo's browser environment without sending data to external servers. Copy the generated tags and verify your implementation using Twitter's Card Validator tool after deployment.","p3":"Marketing teams launching campaigns ensure tweet links display compelling previews that drive traffic to landing pages. Content creators sharing blog posts optimize headlines and images specifically for Twitter's visual format to maximize engagement. Product launches benefit from large image cards that showcase new features prominently in users' timelines. News organizations control how breaking stories appear when journalists share articles, maintaining brand consistency across social media.","p4":"Use summary_large_image card type for content where the visual is the primary draw, and standard summary for text-focused articles where the headline matters more. Your image should be at least 300x157 pixels for summary cards or 800x418 pixels for large image variants to avoid pixelation. Keep titles under 70 characters since Twitter truncates longer text in the card display. Test your cards after publishing by sharing the URL in a tweet draft to see the actual preview before posting publicly. Clear Twitter's cache by submitting your URL to their Card Validator if you update tags and don't see changes immediately.","p5":"Yes, Twitter reads Open Graph tags as a fallback when Twitter Card tags are absent. However, Twitter Card tags provide more control over the specific format and display, so using dedicated twitter:card tags is recommended for optimal presentation."},"instagram-font-generator":{"p2":"Type your text into the input field and instantly see it transformed into dozens of Unicode font variations below. Each style uses special Unicode characters that look like different fonts but are actually unique character codes recognized across all platforms. Scroll through options ranging from bold and italic to script, gothic, and decorative styles. Click any transformed text to copy it to your clipboard, then paste directly into your Instagram bio, captions, or comments. Tuttilo generates these fonts in your browser without any server processing, keeping your content private.","p3":"Influencers make their Instagram bios stand out in crowded niches by using distinctive fonts that catch visitor attention immediately. Small businesses add stylistic flair to product descriptions and promotional posts without needing graphic design software. Content creators emphasize specific words in captions using bold or italic Unicode variants for visual hierarchy. Artists and musicians establish unique personal branding through consistent use of signature font styles across their social profiles.","p4":"Test your chosen font style on multiple devices before committing since some Unicode characters may render differently across operating systems and apps. Avoid overusing decorative fonts in long-form captions as they can reduce readability and accessibility for screen readers. Use bold or italic variants to emphasize key phrases rather than applying fancy fonts to entire paragraphs. Remember that while these fonts work on Instagram, they may not display correctly in all apps or platforms, so keep a plain-text version of important information. Combine standard text with styled accents rather than formatting everything for maximum impact.","p5":"These aren't actual fonts—they're Unicode characters from mathematical, linguistic, and symbol blocks that resemble styled Latin letters. Because they're part of the Unicode standard, they work anywhere that accepts Unicode text, unlike images or custom web fonts."},"hashtag-generator":{"p2":"Enter a keyword or topic related to your post's subject matter into the search field. The generator analyzes your input and suggests relevant hashtags organized by category and popularity level.

All image processing happens in your browser using canvas manipulation, so your photos never upload to external servers. Download the optimized image and upload it directly to your chosen social platform for perfect display.","p3":"Social media managers prepare campaign visuals across multiple platforms without manually calculating dimensions for each. Influencers resize personal photos to fit Instagram's square posts, portrait stories, and landscape feed requirements in one workflow. Marketing teams create Facebook ad creatives that meet the platform's recommended sizes for optimal delivery and engagement. Content creators repurpose YouTube thumbnails for Twitter headers or LinkedIn banners by quickly generating correctly sized variants.","p4":"Design your original image larger than your largest needed dimension so you're always scaling down rather than up, which preserves quality. Leave important text and faces toward the center of compositions since different aspect ratios crop differently from edges. Use the preview feature to verify critical elements like logos and call-to-action text remain visible after cropping. Save a master file at maximum resolution before generating platform-specific sizes to enable future format changes. Check updated dimension requirements quarterly since platforms occasionally adjust recommended image sizes and aspect ratios.","p5":"Yes, all processing uses HTML5 Canvas API running in your browser. Your images are never uploaded to any server. The file stays on your device throughout the resizing process, and you download the result directly from your browser's memory."},"emoji-picker":{"p2":"Browse emojis organized into intuitive categories like Smileys, Animals, Food, Activities, Travel, Objects, Symbols, and Flags.

Content creators establish their niche and value proposition in Instagram bios that convince visitors to hit the follow button. Small business owners distill their brand message into bio space that converts profile visitors into customers or email subscribers.","p4":"Front-load your bio with your most important information since some platforms truncate text or users don't read beyond the first line. Include a clear call-to-action like 'DM for collabs' or 'Shop link below' that tells visitors what to do next. Use line breaks and emoji strategically to improve scannability rather than dense paragraph blocks. Update your bio regularly to reflect current projects, availability, or seasonal offers rather than letting it grow stale. A/B test different bio approaches over a few weeks to see which drives better follower conversion or link clicks.","p5":"Instagram allows 150 characters in bios. Twitter/X gives you 160 characters. LinkedIn provides 2,600 characters for your 'About' section. TikTok limits you to 80 characters. Each platform has different norms and optimal strategies for bio content."},"random-number-generator":{"p2":"Set your desired minimum and maximum range values using the number inputs.

QA testers fill out registration forms repeatedly during automated testing without manually inventing unique credentials each time. Designers create mockups showing realistic user interfaces filled with plausible names and addresses instead of 'Lorem Ipsum' placeholders. Database administrators train new team members using safe synthetic datasets that look real but contain no actual customer information.","p4":"Generate more data than you need upfront to avoid inconsistent patterns if you have to generate multiple batches later. Use consistent seed values if your testing framework supports it to get reproducible fake data across test runs. Verify that generated phone numbers and postal codes match the geographic region you're simulating to catch validation bugs. Combine fake data generation with your own domain-specific field values like product IDs or category names for comprehensive test datasets. Never use this data for actual communication—while it looks real, the emails are invalid and addresses are likely nonsensical.","p5":"No. The data is randomly generated using common patterns and name databases, but is completely synthetic. Email addresses are formatted correctly but don't exist. Phone numbers use valid formats but aren't real numbers. Addresses combine real city names with random street names."},"barcode-generator":{"p2":"Enter the text or numbers you want to encode as a barcode into the input field. The tool generates a Code 128 barcode automatically as you type, rendering it as a scannable image.

QA engineers create test datasets for stress-testing pagination, search, and filtering features. Database administrators generate sample records to test query performance and indexing strategies. API developers need realistic mock data to demonstrate endpoints in documentation. Students learning SQL or database design practice queries on substantial datasets without manual entry. Frontend developers test table layouts, list views, and infinite scroll implementations with diverse content.","p4":"Generate larger datasets than you initially think you need—testing with 10 records often misses bugs that appear with 1,000. For realistic testing, combine multiple dataset types (users + orders + products) to simulate relational database structures. When testing pagination, generate enough records to fill at least 5-10 pages. Vary the generation seed or regenerate multiple times to catch edge cases in sorting and filtering logic. For UI testing, pay attention to generated text lengths to ensure your layouts handle both short and long content gracefully.","p5":"The tool uses seedable random generation algorithms to create diverse but consistent data across multiple runs when needed. Email addresses follow proper RFC standards and include various domain patterns. Phone numbers use realistic country code and area code formats for international testing. Generated dates span realistic ranges—user registrations from the past 2 years, order dates within the last 90 days. Product prices follow logarithmic distribution to simulate real market patterns. CSV exports include proper escaping for fields containing commas or quotes."},"svg-wave-generator":{"p2":"Choose the number of wave layers (1-4), adjust the wave height and smoothness sliders, then select colors for each layer using the gradient picker. The preview updates in real-time as you modify parameters. Wave patterns can be positioned at the top or bottom of the image, making them ideal for section dividers. The smoothness control affects how organic versus geometric the waves appear. Once satisfied with your design, copy the SVG code directly or download it as an SVG file.

When ready, click the download button to save your wallpaper as a high-quality PNG file. All rendering happens in your browser using HTML5 Canvas, ensuring your color choices and resolution settings remain private.","p3":"Remote workers create calming desktop backgrounds that reduce eye strain during long work sessions. Content creators generate custom backgrounds for video calls, YouTube thumbnails, and social media graphics. Graphic designers produce base layers for further editing in design software without starting from scratch. Minimalist enthusiasts craft subtle wallpapers that complement their desktop aesthetic without distracting from work. Developers test monitor color accuracy and gradient banding by generating smooth multi-stop gradients. Multiple monitor setups benefit from generating matching wallpapers at different aspect ratios that share the same color scheme.","p4":"For the smoothest gradients without banding, use colors with similar saturation levels and avoid transitioning directly between complementary hues. Generate wallpapers at your display's native resolution rather than scaling from lower sizes to prevent blur. For multi-monitor setups, create gradients with the combined resolution (e.g., 3840x1080 for dual 1920x1080 displays) to flow seamlessly across screens. Add a third color stop in the middle of your gradient to create more complex color transitions. Test your gradient on different backgrounds in your OS theme to ensure good contrast with desktop icons and window elements.","p5":"The Canvas API renders gradients with smooth color interpolation in the sRGB color space. High-resolution outputs (4K and above) are generated using efficient chunked rendering to prevent browser memory limitations. Linear gradients support any angle from 0-360 degrees for precise directional control. Radial gradients emanate from the center point with customizable radius. The PNG export uses maximum quality settings with no compression artifacts in gradient areas."},"invoice-generator":{"p2":"Fill in your business details in the header section, including company name, address, and contact information.

Assign sequential invoice numbers using a consistent format like \"INV-2026-001\" for easy tracking and professional appearance. For recurring clients, save common line items as templates in a text file for quick copy-paste. Double-check tax calculations manually when working across tax jurisdictions. Set the payment due date strategically—shorter payment windows improve cash flow. Before sending, preview the PDF to ensure all information fits on one page for easier printing by clients.","p5":"The tool calculates subtotals and tax amounts using JavaScript decimal arithmetic to avoid floating-point precision errors. Multiple currency symbols are supported including USD, EUR, GBP, and others. The invoice layout follows standard business invoice formats with clearly separated sections for sender, recipient, and line items. Print stylesheets ensure the invoice renders cleanly on PDF without browser UI elements.

Handmade goods sellers at craft fairs create receipts that add credibility to their transactions. Property managers document security deposit returns with itemized deductions. Parents create mock receipts for teaching children about money, prices, and change calculation in a hands-on way.","p4":"For authenticity, include your business tax ID or registration number in the store information section. Use precise pricing (e.g., $3.99 instead of $4) to match real retail scenarios. When generating receipts for record-keeping, save or screenshot them immediately since the browser doesn't store your data between sessions. For teaching purposes, use realistic item names and prices from actual stores to make the learning experience relatable. Print on standard thermal paper (if available) or regular paper cut to size for a more realistic appearance.","p5":"The receipt layout mimics traditional thermal printer output with monospace fonts and a narrow column width. Line item totals are calculated by multiplying quantity by unit price with two decimal precision. Tax is computed as a percentage of the subtotal and rounded to the nearest cent using banker's rounding. The change calculation subtracts the total (with tax) from the amount tendered. Date and time display in local format based on the browser's locale settings.

E-commerce site owners document their data collection practices when processing customer payments. App developers generate baseline privacy policies that can be reviewed by legal counsel. Website owners update their policies when adding new third-party integrations like chatbots or advertising networks. Students building portfolio sites ensure basic compliance when collecting contact form submissions.","p4":"This generator provides a starting template, but consult a lawyer for review if you collect sensitive data or operate in regulated industries. Be honest about which features you check—including unnecessary disclosures creates compliance burden, while omitting actual data collection practices creates legal risk. Update your privacy policy every time you add new tracking tools, analytics platforms, or data collection forms. Date your privacy policy and maintain an archive of previous versions to demonstrate compliance history. Place a prominent link to your privacy policy in your website footer on every page, not just during account signup.","p5":"The generator creates privacy policies based on common legal requirements including GDPR (EU), CCPA (California), and general data protection principles. Each selected feature triggers inclusion of specific disclosure sections covering data types collected, processing purposes, third-party sharing, retention periods, and user rights. The template includes standard sections for data subject access requests, cookies disclosure, and contact information. Generated policies use plain language to meet readability requirements while maintaining legal terminology where necessary.

Click calculate and Tuttilo instantly computes all subnet parameters: network address, broadcast address, subnet mask in decimal and binary, first usable host IP, last usable host IP, and total number of usable hosts. The results display in both human-readable format and binary representation for educational purposes. All calculations happen in your browser using JavaScript bitwise operations, so your network configurations remain completely private.","p3":"Network administrators plan IP address allocation schemes for new office networks or VLANs. IT students learn subnetting concepts by experimenting with different prefix lengths and observing the resulting address ranges. System engineers validate subnet configurations before implementing firewall rules or routing tables. Cloud architects calculate the required CIDR block size for VPC networks based on expected instance counts. Network technicians troubleshoot connectivity issues by verifying whether two IPs belong to the same subnet. Home lab enthusiasts design complex multi-subnet networks for virtualization environments.","p4":"Remember that the first IP in a subnet is the network address and the last is the broadcast address—neither can be assigned to hosts. For point-to-point links, use /30 subnets which provide exactly 2 usable addresses. When planning growth, choose a subnet mask that provides 30-50% more addresses than your current need to avoid renumbering later. Class-based networking is obsolete—modern networks use CIDR exclusively, so avoid thinking in terms of Class A, B, or C. For IPv4 address exhaustion, consider private RFC 1918 ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) with NAT.","p5":"The calculator performs bitwise AND operations between the IP address and subnet mask to derive the network address. The broadcast address is computed by setting all host bits to 1. Usable host count is calculated as 2^(32-prefix length) - 2, subtracting the network and broadcast addresses. Binary representations show the distinction between network and host portions of the address. All four octets are validated to ensure they fall within the 0-255 range. The tool supports all valid CIDR prefix lengths from /0 to /32."},"ip-converter":{"p2":"Paste or type an IPv4 address in any supported format: dotted decimal (192.168.1.1), hexadecimal (0xC0A80101), binary (11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001), or 32-bit decimal integer (3232235777). The tool automatically detects the input format and instantly converts it to all other representations. Each conversion is computed using JavaScript bitwise operations with full accuracy. The interface displays all four formats simultaneously, making it easy to copy the representation you need. This is particularly useful when working with network programming, security analysis, or low-level protocol implementation.","p3":"Security researchers convert IP addresses found in hexadecimal format within packet captures or binary logs. Network programmers work with IP addresses stored as 32-bit integers in databases or binary file formats. Reverse engineers analyze network protocols that encode IPs in non-standard formats. System administrators decode IP addresses from memory dumps or raw network traffic. Malware analysts investigate obfuscated IP addresses that attackers encode to evade detection. Developers test IP parsing functions by generating test cases in multiple formats.","p4":"When debugging network code, hexadecimal format makes it easier to spot byte-order (endianness) issues in raw socket programming. Binary representation helps visualize subnet boundaries and understand how subnet masks work at the bit level. The 32-bit integer format is most efficient for database storage and numerical comparisons. For security analysis, be aware that attackers sometimes obfuscate IPs using decimal or hex notation to bypass simple string-based filters. When copying values, verify the format matches what your target system expects—some tools are strict about dotted decimal versus integer representation.","p5":"The converter handles all valid IPv4 addresses from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255. Hexadecimal input accepts both 0x prefix and raw hex formats. Binary input supports both dotted binary (8 bits per octet) and 32-bit continuous binary strings. Decimal integer input accepts values from 0 to 4294967295 (2^32-1). Each octet is validated to ensure it remains within the 0-255 range after conversion. The tool uses JavaScript's bitwise operators for efficient computation without floating-point precision issues."},"bandwidth-calculator":{"p2":"Select your file size and unit (bytes, KB, MB, GB, or TB) using the dropdown menus. Enter your connection speed and choose the appropriate unit (Kbps, Mbps, or Gbps). The calculator immediately displays the estimated transfer time in hours, minutes, and seconds. Toggle between download and upload scenarios if your connection has asymmetric speeds. The calculation accounts for real-world overhead and assumes sustained throughput at the specified speed. For large files or slow connections, the tool shows progressively larger time units to make the duration more comprehensible.","p3":"System administrators estimate backup completion times before scheduling overnight backup jobs to remote storage. Content creators calculate how long it will take to upload large video files to cloud platforms or clients. IT departments plan data migration timelines when moving terabytes between data centers. Users with metered connections estimate data transfer costs before downloading large datasets. Network planners determine if current bandwidth is sufficient for new applications like video conferencing. Travelers assess whether hotel WiFi speeds are adequate for their work needs before booking.","p4":"Real-world transfer speeds are typically 60-80% of the rated connection speed due to TCP overhead, latency, and network congestion—budget extra time accordingly. For critical transfers, test with a small file first to measure actual throughput rather than relying on advertised speeds. When downloading from the internet, remember the source server's upload speed may be the bottleneck, not your download speed. For very large transfers, consider using parallel connections or resumable transfer protocols to handle interruptions. Calculate bandwidth requirements for recurring transfers (daily backups) to ensure they complete within your maintenance window.","p5":"The calculator converts all units to bits per second internally for accurate computation. Transfer time is calculated by dividing file size (in bits) by bandwidth (in bits per second). Results are displayed in human-readable format with automatic unit selection (seconds, minutes, hours, or days). The tool assumes 8 bits per byte for size conversions and uses standard 1000-based units for network speeds (1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bps). No server upload is required—all calculations happen in your browser using JavaScript arithmetic."},"mac-address-generator":{"p2":"Click the generate button to create a cryptographically random MAC address using your browser's Web Crypto API. Choose your preferred format from the dropdown: colon-separated (00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E), hyphen-separated (00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E), or dot-separated Cisco format (001A.2B3C.4D5E). The tool generates a locally administered, unicast MAC address by default, setting the appropriate bits in the first octet. Each generated address is truly random and suitable for testing, development, or network simulation. Click copy to grab the address for use in virtual machines, emulators, or network configuration tools.","p3":"Virtualization administrators assign unique MAC addresses to virtual machines when cloning or deploying templates. Network engineers test MAC address filtering rules on switches and wireless access points. Developers building network simulators or emulators need realistic MAC addresses for virtual interfaces. Security testers verify MAC address randomization features in operating systems or privacy tools. IoT developers provision MAC addresses for embedded devices during firmware development. System administrators create isolated test networks with non-conflicting MAC addresses for lab environments.","p4":"Always use locally administered MAC addresses (second hex digit 2, 6, A, or E) for testing to avoid conflicts with real hardware. Multicast MAC addresses (odd first octet) are used for group communication, not for host interfaces. When creating persistent virtual machines, save the generated MAC address to ensure the same network identity across reboots. Most virtualization platforms auto-generate MACs, but manual specification prevents duplicate addresses when importing VMs from different sources. For wireless testing, remember that some access points enforce MAC address registration regardless of randomization.","p5":"The generator uses window.crypto.getRandomValues() for cryptographic-quality randomness. The universal/local bit (bit 1 of the first octet) is set to 1 to indicate a locally administered address. The multicast bit (bit 0 of the first octet) is set to 0 to indicate a unicast address. Each of the six octets is randomly generated and formatted according to the selected notation. The tool supports all three common MAC address formats used across different networking vendors and platforms."},"port-reference":{"p2":"Browse the comprehensive list of well-known and registered TCP and UDP ports, or use the search box to find specific services by port number or name. Click the protocol filter buttons to show only TCP, only UDP, or both protocols. Each entry displays the port number, protocol, and the service or application that typically uses it. The reference includes ports 0-1023 (well-known ports) and many commonly used registered ports up to 65535. All data is built into the tool and loads instantly without internet access, making it useful for offline troubleshooting.","p3":"System administrators verify which services are running on specific ports during security audits. Network engineers troubleshoot firewall rules by looking up the standard port for a service. Security analysts investigate unusual network traffic by researching unfamiliar port numbers in logs. Developers choose appropriate port numbers for custom applications while avoiding conflicts with standard services. Students learning networking memorize common port associations for certification exams. Penetration testers identify services running on non-standard ports during reconnaissance phases.","p4":"Memorize the most critical ports for quick recognition: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 3389 (RDP), 3306 (MySQL), 5432 (PostgreSQL). Remember that many services can run on non-standard ports for security through obscurity, though this shouldn't replace proper security measures. TCP and UDP port numbers are independent—port 53 TCP and port 53 UDP are different services (though DNS uses both). Ephemeral ports (49152-65535) are dynamically assigned for client connections. When designing custom services, choose ports above 1024 to avoid requiring root privileges on Unix systems.","p5":"The reference database includes IANA-assigned port numbers for well-known services and commonly used applications. Entries are searchable by port number or service name using case-insensitive matching. TCP and UDP protocols are indicated separately since the same port number can be used for different services on different protocols. The search function filters results in real-time as you type. No external API calls are made—the entire port database is embedded in the application for instant access and offline functionality."},"ip-range-calculator":{"p2":"Enter a network address in CIDR notation (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24 or 192.168.0.0/22) into the input field and click calculate. The tool computes and displays the first IP address in the range, the last IP address, and the total count of addresses in that subnet. For smaller subnets (/24 and smaller, 256 addresses or fewer), the tool also generates and displays the complete list of all IP addresses in the range. Larger subnets show only the summary information to avoid overwhelming your browser. All calculations use efficient JavaScript bitwise operations.","p3":"Network administrators audit IP address allocation to identify available addresses in existing subnets. Cloud engineers determine how many EC2 instances or VMs can fit in a planned VPC subnet. Security teams generate lists of IP addresses for bulk firewall rule configuration. DevOps engineers populate IP address pools for load balancers or container orchestration. Network planners verify subnet size meets requirements before proposing CIDR blocks to IPAM systems. Penetration testers enumerate all possible host addresses in target network ranges during reconnaissance.","p4":"For production use, avoid manually enumerating large subnets—a /16 contains 65,536 addresses which can freeze your browser. Subnets larger than /24 rarely need full enumeration; focus on the first/last IP and total count. Remember that network (first) and broadcast (last) addresses are not usable for hosts in typical configurations. When planning subnet sizes, account for growth but avoid excessive waste—a /20 provides 4,096 addresses but only 4,094 are usable. For datacenter subnets, reserve the first few host addresses for routers, gateways, and infrastructure services.","p5":"The calculator uses bitwise operations to compute the network address by ANDing the input IP with the subnet mask. The last IP is derived by setting all host bits to 1. Address count is calculated as 2^(32-prefix_length). For subnets /24 and smaller, the tool iterates through all addresses by incrementing the network address by 1 until reaching the last address. Results are validated to ensure the input IP is a valid network address (host bits are zero). The tool supports all CIDR prefix lengths from /0 (entire IPv4 space) to /32 (single host)."},"user-agent-parser":{"p2":"Paste any browser User-Agent string into the text area—you can find your current one displayed at the top of the tool. Click parse, and the tool extracts detailed information including browser name, version, operating system, device type (desktop, mobile, tablet), and rendering engine. The parser handles User-Agent strings from all major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and mobile browsers. Results are displayed in a structured format showing each identified component. Your current User-Agent is detected automatically for quick reference. All parsing happens in your browser using pattern matching and regular expressions.","p3":"Web developers debug browser-specific issues by analyzing User-Agent strings from bug reports. Analytics teams understand their audience by decoding User-Agent data from server logs. QA engineers verify that their testing tools correctly identify browser and OS combinations. Security researchers identify suspicious or spoofed User-Agents in traffic logs. Web scraping developers test how their tools appear to target servers. Support teams diagnose customer issues by asking them to paste their User-Agent string for environment identification.","p4":"Modern web development should avoid User-Agent sniffing for feature detection—use feature detection APIs instead. However, for analytics and logging, User-Agent parsing remains valuable. Be aware that User-Agents can be easily spoofed, so never rely on them for security decisions. Mobile browsers often include multiple identifiers (like \"Mobile Safari\" containing both \"Safari\" and \"Chrome\"). The User-Agent string format is not standardized, leading to complex parsing logic with many edge cases. Google Chrome and Edge include \"Safari\" in their UA strings due to historical compatibility reasons.","p5":"The parser uses regular expressions to extract key components from the User-Agent string format. Browser detection patterns match known signatures for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera, and others. Operating system identification covers Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and ChromeOS. Version numbers are extracted using numeric pattern matching after browser identifiers. Device type is inferred from keywords like \"Mobile\", \"Tablet\", or \"iPad\" in the string. Engine detection identifies Blink, Gecko, WebKit, and Trident rendering engines based on standard UA conventions."},"http-header-analyzer":{"p2":"Copy HTTP response headers from your browser's developer tools (Network tab) or from a curl command output. Paste the raw header text into the input area—include both the header names and values, one per line. Click analyze, and the tool parses each header, identifies its category (caching, security, CORS, content type, etc.), and provides a brief explanation of what it does. Security headers like CSP, HSTS, and X-Frame-Options are highlighted with their configuration details. The analysis helps you understand server configuration and identify missing security headers.","p3":"Security engineers audit website security posture by checking for missing or misconfigured security headers. Frontend developers debug CORS issues by examining Access-Control headers from API responses. Performance engineers analyze caching headers to optimize CDN and browser cache behavior. DevOps teams verify correct header configuration after deploying new web servers or proxies. Penetration testers identify security weaknesses like missing CSP or permissive CORS policies. Students learning web security understand how headers affect browser behavior and security policies.","p4":"Security headers like Content-Security-Policy can break functionality if misconfigured—test thoroughly in staging before production. The order of headers generally doesn't matter, but some proxies or servers may behave unexpectedly. Missing Strict-Transport-Security leaves users vulnerable to SSL-stripping attacks—add it immediately on HTTPS sites. Permissive CORS headers (Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *) should never be used with credentials. Check Cache-Control on dynamic content to prevent browsers from caching personalized or sensitive data. X-Frame-Options and CSP frame-ancestors both control iframe embedding—ensure they don't conflict.","p5":"The analyzer uses line-by-line parsing to split header strings into name-value pairs separated by colons. Each header name is matched against a database of known HTTP headers to determine its purpose and category. Multi-line header values (folded with continuation lines) are normalized into single values. The tool recognizes standard categories including caching (Cache-Control, ETag), security (CSP, HSTS, X-XSS-Protection), CORS (Access-Control-*), content (Content-Type, Content-Length), and cookies (Set-Cookie). Explanations are generated based on header semantics and common configurations."},"exif-viewer":{"p2":"Select a JPEG or TIFF image file from your device using the file picker. The tool reads the embedded EXIF metadata tags directly from the binary file structure without uploading anything to a server. Within seconds, you'll see extracted data organized into categories: camera information (make, model, lens), capture settings (ISO, aperture, shutter speed, focal length), date and time taken, GPS coordinates if available, and other technical metadata. The raw GPS coordinates can be copied or clicked to open the location in mapping services. All processing happens entirely in your browser using JavaScript binary parsing libraries.","p3":"Photographers verify camera settings for shots they want to replicate or understand how a particular photo was captured. Privacy-conscious users check images for GPS location data before sharing on social media to prevent doxxing. Digital forensics investigators extract metadata to verify image authenticity and creation timestamps. Real estate photographers confirm geolocation data is embedded before uploading listings. Photo organizers sort images by camera model or date when filenames don't provide useful information. Travelers view GPS coordinates from old photos to remember where specific pictures were taken.","p4":"Smartphone photos often contain more EXIF data than you expect, including precise GPS coordinates—always check before posting images online. Many social platforms strip EXIF data during upload, but email, messaging apps, and file sharing often preserve it. Editing a photo in most software preserves the original EXIF unless you explicitly remove it during export. GPS coordinates in EXIF use decimal degrees format (latitude/longitude)—copy these carefully if navigating. For privacy, use EXIF removal tools before sharing images that might reveal home or work locations. Professional cameras embed more technical data than smartphones, making EXIF especially useful for learning photographic techniques.","p5":"The viewer parses the EXIF segment from JPEG files using the APP1 marker format defined in the EXIF specification. Tag values are decoded based on their data type (ASCII, short, long, rational) using proper byte order (endianness) indicated by the TIFF header. GPS coordinates are stored as rational values (degrees, minutes, seconds) and converted to decimal degrees for display. Date/time values follow the format YYYY:MM:DD HH:MM:SS and are extracted as-is from the DateTimeOriginal tag. The tool supports both big-endian and little-endian TIFF byte ordering for cross-platform compatibility."},"file-hash-checker":{"p2":"Select any file from your device—documents, images, videos, archives, executables, or any other file type. The tool reads the entire file in chunks and computes four cryptographic hash values simultaneously: SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. Progress is shown as the file is processed, which is especially useful for large files over 100MB. Once complete, all four hash values are displayed in hexadecimal format, ready to copy. Compare these values against published checksums to verify file integrity and detect tampering. The entire file is processed locally in your browser using the SubtleCrypto API—nothing is uploaded.","p3":"Software developers verify downloaded libraries or binaries match the official release by comparing SHA-256 checksums. Security researchers confirm malware samples are identical to reported specimens using hash matching. System administrators validate ISO images downloaded for server installations haven't been corrupted or modified. Users verify that files downloaded from torrents or mirrors are authentic by checking against published hashes. Digital archivists create checksums for long-term storage to detect bit rot or corruption over time. Forensic analysts compute file hashes for evidence integrity and chain-of-custody documentation.","p4":"SHA-1 is considered cryptographically broken for security purposes—use SHA-256 or higher for integrity verification. When sharing files, publish the hash on a different channel (e.g., HTTPS website) than the file download itself to prevent attackers from replacing both. Large files may take several seconds to hash—this is normal and indicates thorough processing. For critical security applications, verify the hash using two different tools to rule out implementation bugs. File modification of even a single bit produces a completely different hash, making checksums excellent tamper-detection mechanisms.","p5":"The tool uses the Web Crypto API's digest() method for hardware-accelerated hashing when available. Files are read in 64MB chunks to prevent memory exhaustion on large files. All four hash algorithms (SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512) are computed in parallel for efficiency. The binary hash output is converted to hexadecimal strings using byte-to-hex conversion. File reading uses the FileReader API with arraybuffer result type for binary data handling. Progress percentage is calculated based on bytes processed versus total file size."},"text-steganography":{"p2":"To hide a message, enter your normal-looking cover text in the first field and your secret message in the second. Click encode, and the tool embeds your secret into the cover text using zero-width Unicode characters (ZWSP, ZWJ, ZWNJ) that are invisible but preserved when the text is copied. The resulting text looks identical to the original but contains hidden data. To reveal a message, paste text that you suspect contains hidden content and click decode. If steganographic data is present, the secret message will be extracted and displayed. All encoding and decoding happens in your browser using Unicode character manipulation.","p3":"Privacy activists share sensitive information in plain sight by embedding coordinates or contact details in public messages. Social media users watermark their original content with hidden authorship tags to prove ownership if reposted. Journalists hide source identifiers in published articles as insurance against leaked documents. Developers embed metadata or copyright info in code comments using invisible characters. Whistleblowers communicate through seemingly innocuous messages on monitored platforms. Students hide cheat sheets in allowed materials using invisible text for exams (though we don't recommend this).","p4":"The hidden message is fragile—some platforms and text editors strip zero-width characters, destroying the steganography. Test your target platform by encoding and decoding a test message first. Longer cover text can hide longer secrets with better concealment. Don't rely on this for high-security communications—sophisticated analysis can detect unusual character patterns. Copy-paste the encoded text rather than retyping it to preserve the invisible characters. For maximum compatibility, keep cover text to simple ASCII or common Unicode characters.","p5":"The encoding algorithm converts each bit of the secret message to zero-width characters: 0 becomes ZWSP (U+200B) and 1 becomes ZWJ (U+200D). These characters are inserted between characters in the cover text at regular intervals. The secret message is first converted to binary using UTF-8 encoding, then each bit is mapped to a zero-width character. Decoding extracts all zero-width characters, maps them back to binary bits, then converts the binary to UTF-8 text. The tool preserves the cover text exactly while injecting invisible characters in the interstitial positions."},"ssl-certificate-decoder":{"p2":"Paste a PEM-encoded X.509 certificate into the text area—this includes the lines starting with \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\" and ending with \"-----END CERTIFICATE-----\". Click decode, and the tool parses the certificate's ASN.1 DER structure to extract all fields: issuer, subject, validity dates (not before/not after), serial number, signature algorithm, public key algorithm and size, subject alternative names (SANs), and key usage extensions. The information is displayed in a human-readable format with labeled fields. Use this to inspect certificates from servers, certificate files, or chain bundles without installing OpenSSL or other command-line tools.","p3":"System administrators verify certificate details before installing them on web servers to catch configuration errors. Security engineers audit certificate chains to identify weak signature algorithms or short key lengths. Developers debug SSL/TLS issues by examining certificate properties like SANs and expiration dates. DevOps teams validate that new certificates match the intended domains and organizational details. Certificate authorities use decoders to verify certificate generation before issuance. Compliance auditors check that certificates meet organizational standards for key size and validity period.","p4":"Always verify the certificate's validity period—certificates issued for more than 398 days won't be trusted by modern browsers. Check that Subject Alternative Names (SANs) include all domains the certificate will serve, including www and non-www variants. Ensure the signature algorithm is SHA-256 or stronger—SHA-1 is deprecated and will cause browser warnings. RSA keys should be at least 2048 bits; 4096 bits provides better future-proofing. Look for critical extensions like Extended Key Usage (EKU) that may restrict the certificate's use cases. For internal testing, self-signed certificates work, but production always requires a trusted CA.","p5":"The decoder parses PEM format by stripping the header/footer lines and base64-decoding the content to obtain raw DER bytes. DER parsing follows ASN.1 encoding rules to extract tag-length-value structures. The certificate structure is parsed according to the X.509 v3 specification with fields like issuer, subject (Distinguished Names), validity (UTCTime or GeneralizedTime), and extensions. Subject Alternative Names are extracted from the v3 extensions field. Public key information includes algorithm identifier (RSA, ECDSA) and key size in bits. All date/time values are converted from ASN.1 time formats to human-readable strings."},"csr-generator":{"p2":"Select your desired algorithm: RSA with 2048 or 4096-bit key size, or ECDSA with the P-256 elliptic curve. Click generate, and the tool creates a cryptographic key pair using your browser's Web Crypto API. The private key and public key are both displayed in PEM format, ready to copy or download. Private keys are generated using cryptographically secure random number generation. For RSA, the public exponent is 65537. For ECDSA, the NIST P-256 curve provides equivalent security to 3072-bit RSA. Store your private key securely—it never leaves your browser during generation.","p3":"Developers create key pairs for testing SSL/TLS implementations without exposing production keys. System administrators generate new keys for web servers, VPNs, or SSH access. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts experiment with public-key cryptography concepts. Security students learn about asymmetric encryption by generating and examining real key pairs. IoT developers create device-specific keys for mutual TLS authentication. Certificate authorities generate intermediate signing keys in air-gapped environments for maximum security.","p4":"Never generate production keys on a shared or untrusted computer—use a secure, offline machine for critical keys. RSA 4096-bit keys provide better future security but are slower for operations than 2048-bit keys; choose based on your security vs. performance needs. ECDSA keys are much smaller than equivalent RSA keys and faster to generate, making them ideal for IoT and mobile applications. Always store private keys encrypted at rest using strong passwords. For SSH, you'll need to convert the PEM format to OpenSSH format using ssh-keygen. Public keys can be freely shared, but treat private keys like passwords—never commit them to version control.","p5":"The generator uses window.crypto.subtle.generateKey() for cryptographically secure key generation with hardware acceleration when available. RSA keys use the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 algorithm with modulus lengths of 2048 or 4096 bits and public exponent 65537. ECDSA keys use the ECDSA algorithm with the P-256 (secp256r1) named curve. Generated keys are exported in SPKI format for public keys and PKCS#8 format for private keys, then base64-encoded and wrapped with PEM headers/footers. No key material is transmitted—generation happens entirely in the browser's cryptographic subsystem."},"ascii-art-generator":{"p2":"Type any text into the input field—keep it relatively short (under 20 characters) for the best visual results. Click generate, and the tool renders your text as ASCII art using a built-in block-letter font where each character is drawn using hash marks, slashes, and other ASCII characters. The output can be scaled to different sizes for various use cases. Copy the generated ASCII art to your clipboard for pasting into plain text environments like terminals, code comments, email signatures, or README files. All rendering happens instantly in your browser using character mapping algorithms.","p3":"Developers create eye-catching banners for command-line tools and script outputs. Programmers add decorative headers to source code files or configuration files. System administrators jazz up MOTD (message of the day) login screens on servers. README authors create memorable project titles in GitHub repository documentation. Retro computing enthusiasts generate text art for BBS systems and terminal-based applications. Social media users create text-based graphics that stand out in plain-text posts or bios.","p4":"Keep your input short—ASCII art width grows exponentially and becomes unwieldy with long text. Use uppercase letters for better visual consistency across different fonts. For multi-line banners, generate each line separately and combine them manually. Test your ASCII art in the actual environment where it will appear (terminal, editor, etc.) since character spacing varies. Monospace fonts are essential—ASCII art breaks in proportional fonts. For CLI tools, consider adding the ASCII art as a constant string in your code rather than generating it at runtime.","p5":"The generator uses a predefined character map where each letter A-Z and digit 0-9 is represented as a multi-line array of ASCII characters. The tool iterates through the input text, looks up each character in the map, and concatenates the corresponding ASCII representations horizontally. Vertical spacing is maintained by processing each row of all input characters before moving to the next row. Unsupported characters are either skipped or rendered as spaces. The output is formatted with line breaks to create the multi-line block letter effect."},"morse-code-translator":{"p2":"Type regular text into the input field to convert it to Morse code, or enter Morse code (dots, dashes, and spaces) to decode it back to text. The tool supports all English letters (A-Z), digits (0-9), and common punctuation marks. Letter boundaries are indicated by spaces, and word boundaries by double spaces in Morse code. Click the play button to hear the audio representation of your Morse code at an adjustable speed (words per minute). The audio uses a standard tone frequency and follows proper Morse timing conventions. All translation happens in your browser using International Morse Code mappings.","p3":"Ham radio enthusiasts practice Morse code recognition and transmission skills. Students learning Morse code for certifications test their proficiency with text-to-Morse conversion. Puzzle and escape room designers create Morse code challenges and verify solutions. Scout leaders teach communication skills using Morse code activities. Emergency preparedness groups train alternative communication methods for situations without modern technology. Makers program LED blinkers or buzzers and need correct Morse patterns for their messages.","p4":"Standard Morse code timing uses the dot duration as the base unit: dashes are 3 units, gaps between symbols in a character are 1 unit, gaps between characters are 3 units, and gaps between words are 7 units. For learning, start at 5-10 WPM and gradually increase speed as you improve recognition. When transmitting, rhythm and consistency matter more than absolute speed. The SOS distress signal (··· --- ···) is universally recognized and requires no other knowledge. For practice, encode familiar phrases rather than random text to build pattern recognition.","p5":"The translator uses a bidirectional mapping object where each alphanumeric character maps to its Morse equivalent (dots and dashes). Text-to-Morse conversion loops through each character, looks it up in the map, and concatenates the results with appropriate spacing. Morse-to-text conversion splits the input by spaces, looks up each Morse sequence in the reverse map, and reconstructs the text. Audio playback uses the Web Audio API to generate sine wave tones at 600Hz with precise timing based on WPM settings. Dot duration is calculated as 1200ms / WPM."},"regex-generator":{"p2":"Select a preset pattern from the dropdown (email, URL, phone, IP address, credit card, etc.) or choose \"Custom\" to write your own regular expression. The regex pattern appears in the editor where you can modify it. Enter sample text in the test area below, and the tool highlights all matches in real-time as you type. Adjust regex flags (case insensitive, multiline, global) using the checkboxes. The match results section shows all captured groups and their positions. Copy the final regex pattern for use in JavaScript, Python, or other languages. All matching happens in your browser using JavaScript's RegExp engine.","p3":"Developers validate user input in forms by testing regex patterns against sample data before implementing validation. Data scientists extract structured information from unstructured text using carefully crafted patterns. Security engineers create WAF rules to detect attack patterns in HTTP requests. Log analysts parse and extract specific fields from application or server logs. Text processing scripts use regex to find-and-replace patterns across large codebases. Content moderators build regex filters to detect prohibited content patterns in user submissions.","p4":"Start with a preset and modify it rather than building complex patterns from scratch. Test your regex against both valid and invalid inputs to catch false positives and false negatives. Remember that regex dialects vary between languages—JavaScript regex may behave differently than Python or PCRE. Use capturing groups ( ) to extract parts of matches, and non-capturing groups (?: ) when you don't need to extract. Escape special characters like . * + ? [ ] { } ( ) ^ $ | \\ with backslashes. For email validation, perfect regex is impossible—use a basic pattern and send a confirmation email.","p5":"The tool uses JavaScript's native RegExp object to compile and execute patterns. Match highlighting is implemented by replacing matched substrings with wrapped spans for CSS styling. Live matching updates on every keystroke using input event listeners with debouncing for performance. Preset patterns are stored as template strings and loaded into the editor when selected. Captured groups are extracted from the RegExp exec() method's result array. Flags are applied by constructing the RegExp with the appropriate flag string (g for global, i for case-insensitive, m for multiline)."},"json-schema-generator":{"p2":"Paste a sample JSON object or array into the input field—this should be representative of the structure you want to define a schema for. Click generate, and the tool analyzes your JSON to infer types for each field, identifies required properties based on presence, and detects nested objects and arrays. The generated JSON Schema follows the Draft-07 specification and includes type definitions, required fields arrays, and nested schemas for objects. You can copy the schema for use in API validation, configuration files, or documentation. Edit the generated schema to add constraints like min/max values, enums, or pattern matching.","p3":"API developers create request and response validation schemas from sample API payloads. Backend engineers generate schema documentation for configuration files by feeding in examples. OpenAPI/Swagger users quickly build schema definitions for API specifications. Data validators bootstrap schema files for JSON data pipelines and ETL processes. Frontend developers create TypeScript interfaces by first generating JSON Schema then converting to types. Database designers model document structures for NoSQL databases like MongoDB or Couchbase.","p4":"Feed the generator comprehensive sample data that includes all possible fields and edge cases—sparse samples produce incomplete schemas. The inferred required fields may not match your actual requirements; review and adjust the \"required\" array manually. For union types (fields that can be multiple types), provide samples showing all variations or manually edit the schema afterward. Add validation constraints (minimum, maximum, pattern, minLength) manually since the generator only infers basic types. For production use, add descriptions to each field for better API documentation. JSON Schema Draft-07 is widely supported; check compatibility before using newer drafts.","p5":"The generator recursively traverses the input JSON structure to determine the type of each value: string, number, boolean, null, array, or object. For objects, it creates a properties map and marks all present keys as required. For arrays, it examines the first element to infer the items schema, assuming homogeneous arrays. Nested objects and arrays are processed recursively to build nested schema definitions. Type inference uses JavaScript's typeof operator and additional checks for null and arrays. The output schema follows JSON Schema Draft-07 format with $schema, type, properties, required, and items fields."},"api-tester":{"p2":"Enter the API endpoint URL you want to test in the URL field. Select the HTTP method from the dropdown (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS). Add custom headers using the key-value inputs—common headers like Content-Type and Authorization can be added. For methods that support a request body (POST, PUT, PATCH), enter your JSON, XML, or form data in the body field. Click send request, and the tool displays the response status code, headers, and body. Response time is measured and displayed. The entire request is made from your browser using the Fetch API.","p3":"Frontend developers test backend APIs during development without writing test scripts or using Postman. API integrators verify third-party API endpoints and debug authentication issues. DevOps engineers check API health endpoints and response times during deployment. Security testers send crafted requests to APIs to test input validation and error handling. Mobile app developers test REST APIs before implementing native HTTP clients. Students learning web development experiment with public APIs to understand HTTP methods and status codes.","p4":"For authenticated APIs, add your Bearer token or API key in the Authorization header—never hardcode credentials in client-side code for production. When testing POST/PUT with JSON, set Content-Type: application/json or the server may reject your request. Check CORS headers if requests fail from the browser—the API must allow your origin. Use OPTIONS method to verify supported HTTP methods before testing. For debugging, examine both request and response headers, not just the body. Response status codes in the 400s indicate client errors (bad request), while 500s indicate server errors.","p5":"The tool uses the Fetch API to make HTTP requests with the specified method, headers, and body. Requests are cross-origin and subject to CORS restrictions imposed by the target server. Headers are sent as a Headers object constructed from the key-value pairs. Request body is sent as-is for POST/PUT/PATCH methods. Response status, headers, and body are extracted from the Response object. Body content is read as text using response.text() and displayed in the interface. Response time is measured using performance.now() before and after the fetch operation."},"scientific-calculator":{"p2":"Use the on-screen buttons or your keyboard to enter numbers and operations. The calculator supports basic arithmetic (+, -, ×, ÷) plus scientific functions including trigonometry (sin, cos, tan), logarithms (log, ln), exponents (x², x^y), square root, and factorial. Access constants π and e via dedicated buttons. The display shows your current expression and the result. Use parentheses for grouping complex expressions. Angle mode switches between degrees and radians for trigonometric functions. Clear your expression with C or delete the last character with backspace. All calculations execute in your browser using JavaScript's Math library.","p3":"Students solve homework problems in physics, chemistry, and calculus courses. Engineers perform quick calculations during design work without opening desktop applications. Programmers verify mathematical formulas before implementing them in code. Researchers compute statistical values, logarithms, and exponential functions during data analysis. Teachers demonstrate mathematical concepts in classrooms using a projector. Online exam takers use the calculator when testing platforms prohibit installing software.","p4":"Switch to radian mode when working with calculus or higher mathematics—degrees are primarily for geometry and navigation. Remember order of operations: parentheses, exponents, multiplication/division (left to right), addition/subtraction (left to right). Use the ANS button to reference the previous result in a new calculation. For very large or very small numbers, the calculator uses scientific notation (e.g., 1.5e+10). The factorial function only works with non-negative integers and has limits around 170 due to JavaScript number precision. When chaining trigonometric operations, verify your angle mode matches your input.","p5":"The calculator uses JavaScript's Math object for all operations: Math.sin(), Math.cos(), Math.log(), Math.exp(), etc. Trigonometric functions receive input in radians; degree mode multiplies input by π/180 before computation. Expression parsing handles operator precedence and parentheses nesting using a recursive descent parser or similar algorithm. Constants π and e use Math.PI and Math.E. The factorial function is computed iteratively for integers up to the precision limit. Results are displayed with appropriate significant figures, using scientific notation for values outside the range 0.000001 to 999999."},"percentage-calculator":{"p2":"The tool offers three calculation modes. Mode 1: \"What is X% of Y?\"—enter the percentage and the number to find the result. Mode 2: \"X is what % of Y?\"—enter two numbers to find what percentage the first is of the second. Mode 3: \"Percentage change from X to Y\"—enter the original and new values to calculate the percentage increase or decrease. Select your desired mode, fill in the input fields, and the result appears instantly as you type. All calculations update in real-time without requiring a calculate button.","p3":"Shoppers calculate discounts during sales to determine final prices after percentage-off promotions. Financial analysts compute percentage changes in stock prices, revenue, or other metrics. Students solve percentage problems for math homework or standardized tests. Budget planners determine what percentage of income goes to various expense categories. Sales teams calculate commission amounts as percentages of sales figures. Nutrition trackers determine what percentage of daily values are met by food portions.","p4":"For percentage of a number (X% of Y), the formula is (X/100) × Y. For \"what percentage\" calculations (X is what % of Y), it's (X/Y) × 100. Percentage change is calculated as ((New - Old) / Old) × 100, where negative results indicate decreases. When comparing percentage changes, remember that a 50% increase followed by a 50% decrease doesn't return to the original value. For financial calculations, understand the difference between percentage points and percentages—interest rising from 2% to 3% is a 1 percentage point increase but a 50% percentage increase. Round percentages appropriately based on context: 2-3 decimal places for precision, whole numbers for general communication.","p5":"Mode 1 multiplies the percentage value by the target number and divides by 100. Mode 2 divides the first number by the second and multiplies by 100. Mode 3 calculates the difference between new and old values, divides by the old value, and multiplies by 100. Negative results in Mode 3 indicate decreases and are prefixed with a minus sign. All calculations use JavaScript's floating-point arithmetic and are rounded to 2 decimal places for display. Input validation ensures non-negative values where appropriate and handles zero denominators by displaying an error message."},"bmi-calculator":{"p2":"Enter your height and weight using either metric (kilograms and centimeters) or imperial (pounds and inches) units. Tuttilo calculates your BMI instantly by dividing your weight by the square of your height. Your result appears immediately with a color-coded indicator showing which category you fall into: underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. All calculations happen directly in your browser, keeping your health data completely private without any server storage.","p3":"Health professionals use this tool for initial patient assessments during routine checkups. Fitness trainers track client progress by calculating BMI at the start and end of programs. Individuals preparing for medical procedures often need to check if they meet specific BMI requirements. Parents monitor their children's growth patterns by comparing BMI results against age-specific percentile charts provided by pediatricians.","p4":"Remember that BMI doesn't account for muscle mass, so athletes and bodybuilders may show elevated readings despite being healthy. For the most accurate tracking, measure yourself at the same time of day, preferably in the morning before eating. Keep a record of your BMI over time rather than focusing on a single measurement. If your result falls outside the normal range, consult a healthcare provider who can assess additional factors like body composition and overall health markers."},"loan-calculator":{"p2":"Input your desired loan amount, annual interest rate as a percentage, and loan term in months or years. The calculator instantly shows your monthly payment amount using the standard amortization formula. You'll see a breakdown of total principal repaid, total interest paid over the life of the loan, and the grand total you'll pay back. An amortization table displays how each payment splits between interest and principal, helping you understand how the loan balance decreases over time. Since everything runs in your browser, your financial information stays completely private.","p3":"Car buyers evaluate different financing options from dealerships by comparing monthly payments at various interest rates. Small business owners determine whether they can afford equipment financing before approaching lenders. Students planning education expenses calculate the true cost of student loans by seeing how interest accumulates. Homeowners considering personal loans for renovations assess the total cost difference between 3-year and 5-year repayment terms.","p4":"Even a small reduction in interest rate dramatically affects total interest paid, so always shop around for the best rate available. Making extra principal payments early in the loan term saves substantially more than paying extra later because interest is frontloaded. Use the amortization table to identify the optimal time for refinancing by seeing when your principal balance drops to specific thresholds. Consider biweekly payment schedules instead of monthly, as this results in 13 full payments per year rather than 12, significantly shortening the loan term."},"mortgage-calculator":{"p2":"Start by entering your home's purchase price and your down payment amount or percentage. Add the interest rate you've been quoted and select your loan term, typically 15 or 30 years. Include your property tax rate and any HOA fees for a complete monthly payment estimate. Tuttilo instantly calculates your principal and interest payment, adds property taxes and fees, then shows your total monthly housing cost. The tool also displays how much you'll pay in total interest over the loan's lifetime and provides a detailed amortization schedule. Your sensitive financial data never leaves your device.","p3":"First-time homebuyers determine their affordable price range by working backward from a comfortable monthly payment. Real estate agents help clients understand the financial impact of different down payment scenarios during house hunting. Homeowners considering refinancing compare their current mortgage payment against potential new terms to calculate long-term savings. Investors evaluating rental properties estimate cash flow by comparing mortgage payments against expected rental income.","p4":"Aim for a down payment of at least 20% to avoid private mortgage insurance, which typically adds 0.5-1% of the loan amount annually. Even a 0.25% difference in interest rate translates to thousands of dollars over a 30-year mortgage, making rate shopping essential. Consider how property taxes may increase over time, especially in rapidly developing areas where reassessments are common. Use the amortization schedule to plan strategic extra payments toward principal, particularly during the early years when interest comprises the largest portion of each payment."},"compound-interest-calculator":{"p2":"Enter your starting principal amount, expected annual interest rate, and investment time frame in years. Choose how often interest compounds (daily, monthly, quarterly, or annually), as more frequent compounding yields higher returns. Optionally add regular monthly contributions to see how consistent investing accelerates growth. Tuttilo generates a year-by-year breakdown showing your balance growth, separating contributed principal from earned interest. A visual chart illustrates the exponential curve of compound growth. All calculations are performed locally in your browser for complete privacy of your financial planning.","p3":"College students model different savings strategies to understand how starting early with small monthly contributions outperforms larger contributions started later. Retirement planners project their nest egg growth by inputting current 401(k) balances with expected contribution rates. Parents saving for children's education calculate how much they need to set aside monthly to reach a specific goal in 18 years. Financial advisors demonstrate to clients the dramatic difference between 6% and 8% annual returns over 30-year periods.","p4":"The Rule of 72 offers a quick mental check: divide 72 by your interest rate to find how many years it takes to double your money. Tax-advantaged accounts like Roth IRAs maximize compound growth since you never pay taxes on the earnings. Starting 10 years earlier with compound interest often produces better results than doubling your contribution amount later. Don't underestimate how regular monthly additions amplify compound growth—a $200 monthly contribution can add more to your final balance than the original principal in long time horizons."},"roi-calculator":{"p2":"Input your initial investment amount and the final value after selling or at the current market price. Specify how long you held the investment in years and months. The calculator immediately computes your net profit or loss, your ROI as a percentage, and your annualized ROI to compare investments with different holding periods. You can also see how your return compares to common benchmarks. Because Tuttilo processes everything client-side, your investment performance data remains completely confidential without any third-party access.","p3":"Stock investors evaluate whether to hold or sell positions by calculating actual returns including dividends. Real estate investors assess the profitability of rental properties by inputting purchase price, renovation costs, and sale price. Business owners determine which marketing campaigns delivered the best return by comparing cost against revenue generated. Cryptocurrency traders track portfolio performance across multiple assets with different entry and exit points.","p4":"Always annualize your returns when comparing investments held for different time periods, as a 20% return over five years is vastly different from 20% in one year. Factor in all costs including transaction fees, taxes, and opportunity costs for accurate ROI calculations. Be cautious when comparing ROI across different asset classes, as higher returns typically come with proportionally higher risk. Track your ROI against relevant benchmarks like the S&P 500 index to understand whether you're truly beating the market after accounting for the time value of money."},"tip-calculator":{"p2":"Enter your total bill amount before tip. Select a standard tipping percentage (15%, 18%, 20%, or 25%) or input a custom percentage that reflects your service experience. If you're splitting the bill, specify how many people are sharing the cost. Tuttilo instantly shows the tip amount, the new total including tip, and how much each person owes if splitting. You can adjust the tip percentage in real-time to see how it affects your total. Your bill details stay private in your browser without being transmitted anywhere.","p3":"Restaurant diners quickly calculate appropriate tips after meals without mental math struggles. Groups splitting dinner bills use this to ensure everyone pays their fair share including tip. Travelers abroad convert local currency amounts and adjust tipping percentages for regional customs. Food delivery app users verify that suggested tips are reasonable before confirming their orders. Bar patrons running tabs throughout the evening calculate their final tip based on accumulated charges.","p4":"Tip on the pre-tax amount rather than the after-tax total to avoid tipping on government fees. In the United States, 20% has become the standard baseline for adequate service, with 15% reserved for subpar experiences and 25% for exceptional service. When using coupons or discounts, calculate your tip based on the original bill amount before reductions to fairly compensate servers. For takeout orders, 10% is generally appropriate since servers don't provide full table service but still package and prepare your order."},"salary-calculator":{"p2":"Enter either your annual salary or hourly wage rate—Tuttilo automatically converts between the two formats. The calculator assumes a standard 40-hour work week and 52 weeks per year (2,080 hours annually). You'll instantly see breakdowns by year, month, week, day, and hour. While the tool provides pre-tax estimates, you can get a rough sense of take-home pay by factoring in your tax bracket separately. All calculations happen directly in your browser, so your compensation information remains private between you and your device.","p3":"Job seekers compare salary offers from different employers that quote compensation in different formats (hourly versus salaried). Freelancers determine appropriate hourly rates by working backward from their desired annual income and expected billable hours. Employees negotiating raises calculate the hourly value of proposed salary increases. Part-time workers transitioning to full-time positions project their annual earnings based on their current hourly rate.","p4":"Remember that salaried positions often include benefits worth 20-30% of base salary, so compare total compensation packages rather than just the numbers. When freelancing, your hourly rate should be significantly higher than an equivalent salaried position to account for self-employment taxes, lack of benefits, and non-billable administrative time. Consider that hourly workers may have variable hours while salaried employees often work beyond 40 hours without additional pay. Geographic location dramatically affects real purchasing power, so a $60,000 salary in a low-cost area may provide better quality of life than $90,000 in an expensive city."},"vat-calculator":{"p2":"Choose whether you want to add VAT to a net price or remove VAT from a gross price that already includes tax. Select a common VAT rate for your region (such as 20% for the UK or 19% for Germany) or input any custom tax percentage. Enter your amount and Tuttilo instantly calculates the result, showing the VAT portion separately from the base amount. This works for sales tax, GST, or any percentage-based tax system. Your transaction details are processed entirely in your browser for complete privacy.","p3":"Small business owners price their products by adding VAT to their base costs to determine customer-facing prices. Accountants reconcile invoices by removing VAT from gross receipts to calculate net revenue for tax filings. Shoppers traveling internationally compare prices by removing different VAT rates to find the true product cost. Freelancers invoicing clients in different countries apply the correct VAT rate for each jurisdiction. Online sellers calculate the inclusive price to display to customers when their e-commerce platform requires tax-inclusive pricing.","p4":"Always clarify whether quoted prices are VAT-inclusive or exclusive before making business deals to avoid miscommunication about final costs. In the EU, B2B transactions often use reverse charge mechanisms where VAT isn't added, while B2C sales must include VAT. Keep detailed records of both net and gross amounts on all invoices for accurate tax reporting. Digital services often have complex VAT rules depending on the customer's location rather than your business location—verify the correct rate applies before invoicing international clients."},"profit-margin-calculator":{"p2":"Input your cost per unit (what you pay) and your selling price (what customers pay), or enter revenue and cost to calculate margin on total sales. Tuttilo instantly displays your gross profit amount, profit margin as a percentage, and markup percentage. You can also work backward by entering a desired profit margin to find what price you should charge. The tool shows the difference between margin (profit as a percentage of price) and markup (profit as a percentage of cost). Because everything runs client-side, your pricing strategy stays confidential.","p3":"Retail store owners set product prices by calculating the markup needed to cover overhead costs and achieve target profit margins. E-commerce sellers evaluate whether products are worth stocking by analyzing supplier costs against competitive market prices. Restaurant managers price menu items by calculating food costs and applying industry-standard margin targets. Consultants structure service packages by determining hourly rates that deliver healthy margins after accounting for business expenses and taxes.","p4":"A 50% margin is not the same as 50% markup—a product that costs $50 sold at $100 has a 50% margin but a 100% markup. Different industries have vastly different typical margins: luxury goods often exceed 80%, while grocery stores operate on 2-3% margins. When calculating margin, include all costs beyond just the product—shipping, packaging, payment processing fees, and returns can erode seemingly healthy margins. Psychological pricing strategies like $19.99 instead of $20 can maintain perceived value while protecting margin through higher volume."},"discount-calculator":{"p2":"Enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage being offered. For multiple discounts (like a 20% off sale plus an additional 10% coupon), the calculator applies them sequentially to show the true final price. Optionally add sales tax to see your complete out-of-pocket cost. Tuttilo displays the discount amount, the sale price before tax, and the final total after tax. You can experiment with different discount scenarios instantly. Your shopping calculations remain private since everything processes in your browser.","p3":"Shoppers during Black Friday sales calculate whether advertised deals are genuinely worthwhile by seeing actual dollar savings. Retail employees help customers understand the final price when stacking store promotions with manufacturer coupons. Bargain hunters comparing prices across stores adjust for different discount amounts to find the true best deal. Business buyers evaluate bulk purchase discounts by calculating the effective price per unit after percentage reductions. Real estate agents help clients calculate net purchase prices after builder incentives and concessions.","p4":"Stacked discounts don't add together—a 20% discount followed by 10% off is actually 28% total savings, not 30%, because the second discount applies to the already-reduced price. Retailers strategically time sales, so comparing a 40% discount now against a potential 50% discount next month requires factoring in whether you truly need the item immediately. Be aware of anchor pricing tactics where original prices are inflated to make discounts seem more impressive. On high-value purchases, negotiating an extra 5% off can save more money than using a percentage-based credit card reward."},"age-calculator":{"p2":"Select your birth date using the date picker or type it in directly. Tuttilo calculates your exact age from birth until today, displaying the result in multiple formats: years and months, total months, total weeks, total days, and total hours. You can also calculate age as of a specific future or past date by changing the \"calculate age as of\" field. The tool accounts for leap years and varying month lengths for precise calculations. Your personal date information is processed entirely in your browser without being stored or transmitted.","p3":"Parents track their infant's age in weeks and months for pediatric appointments that require precise developmental tracking. HR departments verify age eligibility for employment programs or retirement benefits. Event planners calculate exact ages for milestone birthday parties like \"10,000 days old\" celebrations. Legal professionals determine age on specific dates for contracts, insurance policies, or eligibility requirements that have strict age thresholds. Genealogy researchers calculate ancestors' ages at significant historical events.","p4":"For baby age tracking, pediatricians typically measure in weeks until 12 weeks, then switch to months until age 2, so toggle between units accordingly. Age calculations matter for legal purposes—someone born on February 29 in a leap year legally ages one year on either February 28 or March 1 in non-leap years depending on jurisdiction. When calculating someone's age at death for obituaries or genealogy, be careful to use their exact birth date and death date to avoid off-by-one errors. In many cultures, age is counted differently (like Korean age), but this calculator uses the international standard where you turn a year older on your birthday."},"date-diff-calculator":{"p2":"Choose a start date and an end date using the date pickers or by typing dates directly. Tuttilo instantly calculates the duration between them, displaying results in years and months, total months, total weeks, total days, total hours, and total minutes. The calculator automatically handles varying month lengths, leap years, and daylight saving time transitions for accurate results. You can swap the dates or calculate backward from a future date. All date calculations run entirely in your browser to keep your personal timeline information private.","p3":"Project managers calculate workday duration between milestone dates to estimate task completion times and identify scheduling conflicts. Couples track the exact duration of their relationships for anniversary celebrations. Event planners count down days until weddings, conferences, or product launches. Legal professionals calculate statute of limitations periods or contract term durations. Travelers planning trips determine how many days they'll be abroad for visa requirements or travel insurance. Pregnant women track pregnancy progression by calculating weeks between conception dates and due dates.","p4":"When calculating business days rather than calendar days, remember that Tuttilo shows calendar days—you'll need to subtract weekends and holidays separately. For contracts spanning years, always verify whether terms use calendar years or anniversary dates, as \"one year\" can mean different things legally. International date formats (MM/DD/YYYY versus DD/MM/YYYY) cause confusion—double-check which format you're using to avoid calculating the wrong span. Add one day when calculating inclusive ranges where both start and end dates count (like a hotel stay from Monday to Wednesday is three nights, not two)."},"calorie-calculator":{"p2":"Enter your age, biological sex, current weight, and height using your preferred unit system. Select your activity level from sedentary to very active based on how much exercise you do weekly. Tuttilo uses the scientifically-validated Mifflin-St Jeor equation to calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)—the calories you burn at rest—then multiplies by your activity factor to determine your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). The results show your maintenance calories, plus targets for weight loss or weight gain. Your health data stays completely private in your browser.","p3":"Fitness enthusiasts starting new diet plans use TDEE calculations as the foundation for creating caloric deficits or surpluses. Personal trainers establish baseline calorie targets for clients before designing nutrition programs. People recovering from eating disorders work with therapists to understand healthy calorie ranges for their body and activity level. Athletes in weight-class sports calculate their maintenance calories to plan cuts or bulks before competitions. Individuals experiencing unexplained weight changes verify whether their calorie intake aligns with their expenditure.","p4":"BMR decreases as you lose weight, so recalculate every 10-15 pounds to avoid plateaus from eating too many calories for your new body size. Activity multipliers are rough estimates—track your actual weight changes over 2-3 weeks and adjust calories by 200-300 if results don't match expectations. Muscle burns more calories at rest than fat, so strength training increases your BMR over time even without cardio. Don't go below your BMR for extended periods, as severe deficits trigger metabolic adaptation where your body aggressively conserves energy, making further fat loss extremely difficult."},"fraction-calculator":{"p2":"Enter two fractions using the numerator and denominator fields for each fraction. Select your desired operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Tuttilo instantly calculates the result, automatically simplifying to the lowest terms. You'll see the answer as both a proper or improper fraction and as a decimal. The tool also shows the calculation steps so you can understand how the result was derived. All math is performed in your browser without sending data to any server.","p3":"Students completing math homework verify their fraction arithmetic answers and check their work. Bakers scale recipes up or down by multiplying ingredient fractions by conversion factors. Woodworkers and crafters calculate precise measurements when dividing materials or combining dimensions. Pharmacists compute medication dosages that require fraction-based calculations. Teachers create fraction problems and verify answer keys for tests and worksheets.","p4":"When dividing fractions, remember to flip the second fraction (multiply by its reciprocal) rather than trying to divide numerators and denominators separately. Mixed numbers must be converted to improper fractions before performing operations—multiply the whole number by the denominator and add the numerator. Always simplify your final answer by finding the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator. For addition and subtraction, finding the least common denominator is essential—use the product of both denominators if you can't quickly identify a smaller common multiple."},"grade-calculator":{"p2":"Add each assignment, test, or subject by entering its score and weight (how much it counts toward your final grade). For example, enter \"85\" for a score and \"30\" if that assignment is worth 30% of your total grade. Tuttilo calculates your weighted average instantly, showing your percentage score, letter grade, and GPA on a 4.0 scale. You can add unlimited items and adjust weights and scores to see how different scenarios affect your final grade. All calculations happen locally in your browser to keep your academic performance data private.","p3":"College students track their course grades throughout the semester by entering scores as they receive them and projecting final grades. High school students calculate what score they need on a final exam to achieve a desired course grade. Teachers set up grading rubrics by experimenting with different weight distributions to understand how they affect overall grades. Parents help children understand how individual assignment scores contribute to report card grades. Graduate students track cumulative GPA across multiple courses and semesters.","p4":"Front-load your effort on high-weight assignments and exams, as a 95% on an item worth 40% of your grade impacts your final score far more than perfect scores on items worth 5% each. Always clarify your instructor's grading scale—some use a 10-point scale (90-100 = A) while others use a 7-point scale (93-100 = A). If you're close to a grade boundary, sometimes asking for small extra credit opportunities or assignment resubmissions can push you over the threshold. Track your grade weekly rather than waiting until the end of the term, giving you time to adjust your effort allocation or seek help before it's too late."},"break-even-calculator":{"p2":"Enter your total fixed costs (rent, salaries, insurance—expenses that don't change with production volume), your price per unit that customers pay, and your variable cost per unit (materials, direct labor—costs that scale with each item produced). Tuttilo instantly calculates how many units you must sell to break even, where total revenue exactly equals total costs. You'll also see the break-even revenue and contribution margin (price minus variable cost). The tool displays a visual chart showing the break-even point. Your business financial data is processed entirely in your browser.","p3":"Entrepreneurs launching new products determine minimum viable sales volumes before committing to production. Restaurant owners calculate how many covers they need daily to cover rent, payroll, and utilities. Freelance consultants set their rates by understanding how many billable hours they need to cover business expenses. Event planners price tickets for conferences by calculating attendee numbers needed to cover venue and catering costs. Manufacturing businesses evaluate whether new equipment purchases will pay for themselves based on increased production capacity.","p4":"Breaking even is the bare minimum for survival—target a sales volume significantly above break-even to generate profit and handle unexpected expenses. Fixed costs aren't always truly fixed; many \"fixed\" expenses like salaries or rent can change at certain volume thresholds, creating stepped break-even points. Lowering variable costs through better supplier negotiations or process improvements decreases your break-even point more predictably than trying to raise prices. Consider that break-even analysis assumes you can sell all units produced—factor in realistic sales conversion rates and inventory waste for more conservative planning."},"length-converter":{"p2":"Select your starting unit from the dropdown menu, ranging from millimeters to miles. Enter the measurement value you want to convert. Choose your target unit from the second dropdown. Tuttilo instantly converts your measurement, displaying the precise result in the target unit. You can quickly switch between metric and imperial systems, making it perfect for international applications. All conversion calculations happen in your browser using standard conversion factors, ensuring accuracy without requiring an internet connection after the page loads.","p3":"Travelers abroad convert road signs showing kilometers into miles to understand driving distances. Construction workers translate architectural plans between metric and imperial measurements when sourcing international materials. Runners track their workout distances by converting miles to kilometers for races using different standards. Online shoppers verify furniture dimensions when product listings use unfamiliar measurement units. Scientists and engineers ensure measurement consistency when collaborating across countries with different standard systems.","p4":"Remember that precision matters—when converting small measurements like millimeters, rounding errors can compound in subsequent calculations. For construction and manufacturing, always verify which measurement system your tools use before cutting materials. Nautical miles differ from statute miles (1 nautical mile ≈ 1.15 statute miles), so use the correct unit when dealing with maritime or aviation applications. When converting feet to meters for athletic performances, note that track events use precise conversions (100 meters is 109.36 yards, not 100 yards), which explains why world records differ between metric and imperial distances."},"weight-converter":{"p2":"Pick your starting weight unit from options including metric (milligrams, grams, kilograms, tonnes) and imperial (ounces, pounds, stones). Type in your weight value. Select the unit you want to convert to, and Tuttilo shows the converted result immediately with full precision. This works for both small measurements like cooking ingredients and large weights like vehicle masses. The converter uses scientifically standard conversion ratios, and all processing happens client-side in your browser.","p3":"Cooks following international recipes convert ingredient weights from metric to imperial or vice versa. Postal workers and shipping departments calculate package weights in different units to determine shipping rates for domestic versus international carriers. Travelers weigh luggage to verify they meet airline limits specified in kilograms or pounds. Fitness enthusiasts track body weight when their scale displays units different from their tracking app's preferred format. Scientists conducting research convert weights to maintain consistency across papers using different measurement systems.","p4":"A pound (lb) is not the same as a pound mass (lbm) versus pound force (lbf) in technical contexts—this converter uses mass units. British stones (14 pounds each) are rarely used outside the UK and Ireland, but remain common for human body weight in those regions. When measuring precious metals or gems, troy ounces differ from standard (avoirdupois) ounces—use specialized converters for those applications. For cooking, remember that weight and volume conversions depend on ingredient density, so a cup of flour weighs far less than a cup of sugar despite identical volume."},"temperature-converter":{"p2":"Choose your source temperature scale (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin) and enter your temperature value. Select the target scale you want to convert to. Tuttilo instantly calculates and displays the equivalent temperature in the chosen scale. The conversion uses the standard formulas: Fahrenheit = (Celsius × 9/5) + 32, Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15. You can convert between any two scales directly. All calculations happen in your browser, so your data stays private.","p3":"Travelers checking weather forecasts convert Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit to understand what clothing to pack. Cooks follow recipes from other countries by converting oven temperatures to their appliance's scale. Science students complete physics and chemistry homework requiring conversions between absolute (Kelvin) and relative (Celsius/Fahrenheit) scales. HVAC technicians set thermostat systems when replacing units that use different temperature displays. International business professionals prepare for video calls by checking weather in colleagues' cities using their preferred temperature units.","p4":"Celsius and Fahrenheit intersect at -40°, where -40°C equals -40°F—a useful reference point. Water freezes at 0°C (32°F) and boils at 100°C (212°F) at sea level, making Celsius intuitively aligned with water's phase changes. Kelvin has no negative values since it starts at absolute zero (-273.15°C), making it ideal for scientific calculations. For mental approximation, remember that a Celsius degree is 1.8 times larger than a Fahrenheit degree, so Celsius temperatures change less dramatically in everyday weather observations."},"data-size-converter":{"p2":"Select your starting data size unit, from bits up to petabytes. Enter the value you want to convert. Pick your target unit. Tuttilo converts instantly, supporting both decimal (powers of 1000) and binary (powers of 1024) standards. You'll see results in KB, MB, GB, TB, and PB. The converter handles both storage capacity and data transfer rates. Everything processes locally in your browser, keeping your calculations private without server communication.","p3":"System administrators calculate storage requirements when planning server infrastructure or cloud migrations. Photographers estimate how many high-resolution images fit on memory cards or external drives. Video editors determine hard drive capacity needed for projects based on footage size and codec compression. Software developers optimize application size by converting between units to meet app store size limits. Internet users evaluate broadband plans by converting download speeds from megabits per second to understand actual file transfer times.","p4":"Storage manufacturers typically use decimal (1 TB = 1000 GB) while operating systems use binary (1 TiB = 1024 GiB), which explains why your 1 TB drive shows only 931 GB in Windows. Internet speeds are quoted in bits per second, but downloads display in bytes per second—divide by 8 to convert, so 100 Mbps downloads files at approximately 12.5 MB/s. Compressed files may be quoted in their compressed size, but require much more space when extracted. For cloud storage planning, always factor in redundancy and backup copies, typically requiring 2-3× your raw data size."},"area-converter":{"p2":"Select your source area unit from options like square meters, square feet, acres, or hectares. Enter your area measurement. Choose the unit you want to convert to. Tuttilo calculates the conversion immediately, using precise mathematical relationships between units. This handles both small areas like rooms and large parcels like farms. The converter works with metric, imperial, and specialized units like acres and hectares. All computations happen in your browser for instant results without data transmission.","p3":"Real estate agents convert property lot sizes between acres and square feet for listings targeting different buyer preferences. Gardeners plan landscaping projects by converting yard measurements into square meters to order mulch or sod. Farmers calculate field sizes in hectares for agricultural subsidy applications that require metric reporting. Homeowners estimate flooring or paint needs by converting room dimensions into square footage for material purchases. Urban planners translate land parcels between measurement systems when reviewing international development proposals.","p4":"An acre is defined as 43,560 square feet, approximately the area you can plow with an ox in one day—remember this as a rough visualization. Hectares (10,000 square meters) align cleanly with the metric system, making calculations simpler than acres. When converting between square units, remember to square the linear conversion factor (1 meter = 3.28 feet, so 1 m² = 10.76 ft²). For irregularly shaped plots, break the area into rectangles or triangles before measuring to improve accuracy, then sum the areas after converting units."},"volume-converter":{"p2":"Choose your starting volume unit from a range including milliliters, liters, gallons (US and Imperial differ), cups, tablespoons, and teaspoons. Type your volume value. Select your target unit. Tuttilo converts the volume instantly using standard conversion ratios. The tool supports both cooking measurements and industrial volumes like cubic meters. Whether you're scaling recipes or calculating tank capacities, conversions happen immediately in your browser without sending data externally.","p3":"Home cooks convert recipe volumes when their measuring tools use different units than the cookbook. Bartenders scale cocktail recipes from ounces to milliliters for international menus. Aquarium hobbyists calculate water volume in gallons to determine appropriate filter sizes and chemical dosages. Chemical engineers convert process volumes between metric and imperial when working with international specifications. Pharmaceutical professionals measure medication dosages that require precise volume conversions for patient safety.","p4":"US gallons (3.785 liters) differ from UK/Imperial gallons (4.546 liters) by about 20%, so always verify which gallon type applies. A US cup is 236.6 mL while a metric cup is 250 mL—this small difference multiplies when scaling large recipes. Volume conversions don't account for ingredient density, so converting weight-based recipes (250g flour) to volume-based (cups) requires density-specific calculations. For precision applications, remember that fluid ounces measure volume while ounces measure weight—1 fluid ounce of water weighs approximately 1 ounce, but this relationship doesn't hold for other liquids."},"speed-converter":{"p2":"Select your starting speed unit, such as kilometers per hour, miles per hour, meters per second, knots, or Mach. Enter your speed value. Choose the unit you want to convert to. Tuttilo instantly converts your speed using standard conversion factors, accounting for the differences between velocity and pace units. The tool supports everything from walking speeds to supersonic velocities. All calculations run in your browser locally, protecting your data privacy.","p3":"Pilots convert indicated airspeeds between knots and miles per hour for flight planning and communication with controllers. Runners interpret treadmill speeds displayed in miles per hour into their preferred minutes-per-kilometer pace. Scientists analyzing motion in physics experiments convert between meters per second and other units for standardized reporting. Travelers driving internationally convert speedometer readings when rental cars display units different from road signs. Maritime navigators calculate vessel speeds in knots while coordinating with land-based teams using mph or km/h.","p4":"Knots (nautical miles per hour) remain standard in aviation and maritime applications because nautical miles directly relate to Earth's geometry (1 nautical mile ≈ 1 minute of latitude). Mach number represents speed relative to the speed of sound, which varies with air temperature and pressure—Mach 1 at sea level is roughly 767 mph, but slower at higher altitudes. For running pace conversions, remember that faster speeds mean smaller pace numbers, which can be counterintuitive. When converting car speeds, note that 100 km/h equals approximately 62 mph, a useful reference for quick mental approximations on international roads."},"time-converter":{"p2":"Pick your starting time unit from milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years. Input your time value. Select your target unit. Tuttilo converts instantly, showing precise results for your selected units. The converter handles both extremely short durations like milliseconds for programming applications and extended periods like years for project planning. All time calculations process directly in your browser to keep your data private.","p3":"Software developers convert milliseconds to seconds when analyzing program execution times and performance benchmarks. Project managers translate task durations from hours into days or weeks for Gantt charts and resource planning. Scientists conducting experiments convert timing measurements between units for standardized research reporting. Freelancers track billable time by converting minutes worked into decimal hours for invoicing. Astronomers calculate cosmic event durations spanning years for observational planning.","p4":"When converting between small and large units, beware of rounding errors that compound—use full precision in intermediate calculations. Business time conversions often assume standardized values (1 month = 30 days, 1 year = 365 days) that don't account for actual calendar variations in specific date ranges. For programming applications, Unix timestamps measure seconds since January 1, 1970, requiring specialized conversion handling. Remember that time zones and daylight saving time affect real-world time calculations beyond simple unit conversion—this tool converts durations, not specific moments in time across time zones."},"fuel-economy-converter":{"p2":"Choose your starting fuel economy unit: liters per 100 kilometers, kilometers per liter, miles per gallon (US), or miles per gallon (Imperial). Enter your vehicle's fuel economy figure. Select the unit you want to convert to. Tuttilo calculates the conversion instantly, accounting for the inverse relationship between distance-per-fuel and fuel-per-distance metrics. Note that US and Imperial gallons differ, affecting MPG values. The tool processes everything in your browser, keeping your vehicle data private.","p3":"Travelers renting cars abroad convert fuel economy specifications to their familiar units for comparison shopping. Car buyers evaluate vehicles with efficiency ratings in different systems to find the most economical option. Fleet managers track vehicle efficiency across international operations where different regions report using different standards. Environmental advocates calculate and compare carbon footprints when efficiency data uses various measurement systems. Automotive journalists convert manufacturer specifications to their audience's preferred units for reviews.","p4":"Lower L/100km values indicate better efficiency (inverse metric) while higher MPG values indicate better efficiency (direct metric), which can cause confusion when comparing. US MPG is approximately 17% lower than Imperial MPG for the same vehicle because US gallons are smaller. Real-world fuel economy typically runs 15-25% worse than official ratings due to testing methodology limitations—account for this when budgeting fuel costs. Hybrid vehicles often show dramatically better city MPG than highway MPG (opposite of traditional vehicles) due to regenerative braking benefits in stop-and-go traffic."},"shoe-size-converter":{"p2":"Select your starting shoe size system: US Men's, US Women's, UK, European (EU), or centimeters (actual foot length). Enter your shoe size. Pick the sizing system you want to convert to. Tuttilo displays the equivalent size immediately, using standard conversion charts employed by footwear manufacturers. Remember that these conversions are approximations—brands vary slightly in their sizing. The tool processes everything locally in your browser to keep your personal measurements private.","p3":"Online shoppers purchasing shoes from international retailers convert sizes to ensure proper fit before ordering. Travelers buying shoes abroad quickly determine their size in unfamiliar sizing systems. Gift buyers measure recipients' feet in centimeters to order shoes when they don't know the person's stated shoe size. Retailers stocking international brands convert between systems for shelf labeling and inventory management. Athletes ordering specialty sports shoes from manufacturers in different countries verify sizing compatibility.","p4":"US Women's sizes are typically 1.5 sizes larger than US Men's sizes for the same foot length—so a Women's 8 equals a Men's 6.5. UK sizes run about one size smaller than US sizes due to different starting points in their sizing scales. European sizes are based on the Paris point (2/3 cm), making them more precise but less intuitive. Always measure both feet and use the larger measurement, as most people have slightly different sized feet. Shoe size converters show the nearest equivalent, but width (narrow, medium, wide) isn't standardized across systems—order from retailers with flexible return policies when buying international brands."},"pressure-converter":{"p2":"Select your starting pressure unit from Pascal, kilopascal, bar, atmosphere, PSI (pounds per square inch), millimeters of mercury, or Torr. Enter your pressure value. Choose the unit you want to convert to. Tuttilo calculates the conversion instantly using scientifically precise relationships between pressure units. This handles everything from atmospheric pressure to high-pressure industrial applications. All calculations run in your browser, protecting your technical data's privacy.","p3":"Automotive technicians convert tire pressure specifications between PSI and bar when servicing vehicles with international spec sheets. Meteorologists translate atmospheric pressure between millibars and inches of mercury for weather forecasting across different reporting standards. Scuba divers calculate depth-related pressure changes when diving equipment displays units different from training materials. HVAC engineers verify system pressures when equipment specifications use different standards than local regulations require. Laboratory scientists standardize pressure measurements across international research collaborations.","p4":"Standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined as 101.325 kPa, 1.01325 bar, 1 atm, 14.7 PSI, or 760 mmHg—memorize your field's standard for quick reference checks. Gauge pressure measures relative to atmospheric pressure while absolute pressure measures relative to perfect vacuum—verify which type your measurement uses. Tire pressure specifications account for the tire's load-bearing requirements and operating temperature, so don't rely solely on unit conversion without understanding the engineering context. Pascal is the SI unit but impractically small for everyday use, which explains why kilopascals and bars dominate practical applications."},"energy-converter":{"p2":"Enter your value in any supported energy unit and select from a comprehensive range including Joules, kilojoules, calories, kilocalories, watt-hours, kilowatt-hours, BTUs, and electron volts. The tool instantly calculates equivalent values across all units simultaneously, letting you compare electrical energy (kWh), heat energy (BTU), nutritional energy (kcal), and atomic-scale energy (eV) side by side. All conversions happen directly in your browser using precise conversion factors, ensuring your energy data never leaves your device.","p3":"Physics students use this when solving thermodynamics problems that require converting between mechanical work in Joules and heat in calories. Electrical engineers calculate battery capacity by converting watt-hours to Joules for circuit analysis. Nutritionists translate food energy from kilocalories to kilojoules when working with international dietary standards. HVAC technicians convert between BTUs and kilowatts when sizing heating and cooling systems for buildings.","p4":"Remember that calories in nutrition labels are actually kilocalories (kcal) — one food calorie equals 1000 small calories. When working with batteries, note that watt-hours depend on voltage, so a 5000mAh power bank at 3.7V delivers about 18.5Wh of energy. For scientific accuracy, use Joules as your reference unit since it's the SI standard. When converting electron volts, keep in mind this unit is primarily used at atomic and molecular scales — one eV equals approximately 1.602×10⁻¹⁹ Joules."},"number-base-converter":{"p2":"Input your number in any of the four supported bases: binary (base-2), octal (base-8), decimal (base-10), or hexadecimal (base-16). The converter instantly displays the equivalent representation in all other bases, making it easy to verify calculations or translate between programming contexts. Binary output shows the fundamental bit pattern, octal provides compact grouping useful in Unix permissions, and hexadecimal offers the dense format common in memory addresses and color codes. Everything processes locally for complete privacy.","p3":"Software developers use this when debugging assembly code or examining raw memory dumps where hexadecimal values need verification against decimal expectations. Computer science students learning digital logic convert binary truth tables to octal or hex for more readable notation. Unix system administrators translate file permission numbers from octal (like 755) to binary to understand exact read-write-execute flags. Web developers convert hexadecimal color codes to decimal RGB values when working with canvas graphics or image processing.","p4":"Hexadecimal uses 0-9 and A-F where A=10 through F=15 — memorizing this sequence speeds up manual conversions. Each hex digit represents exactly four binary bits, so F in hex equals 1111 in binary, making hex-to-binary conversion straightforward. Octal maps three bits per digit: 7 in octal is 111 in binary. When working with signed integers, remember that negative numbers use two's complement in binary, which flips all bits and adds one. Leading zeros matter in fixed-width contexts like byte arrays (0xFF vs FF) but not for mathematical values."},"roman-numeral-converter":{"p2":"Type an Arabic number between 1 and 3999, or enter a Roman numeral using the standard symbols I, V, X, L, C, D, and M. The converter instantly translates in both directions, showing you how ancient Romans would have written modern numbers and vice versa. The tool recognizes subtractive notation where smaller values before larger ones indicate subtraction (like IV for 4 or IX for 9). All processing happens in your browser, making it perfect for quick reference without internet dependency once loaded.","p3":"History students translate dates from historical documents that use Roman numerals for years, copyright notices, or chapter numbering in old manuscripts. Graphic designers working on classical or elegant branding need Roman numerals for clock faces, building cornerstones, or formal event invitations like weddings and galas. Movie studios use this to encode production years in film credits — converting release years to Roman numerals for that timeless aesthetic. Writers formatting book manuscripts convert chapter numbers to Roman numerals for front matter sections like prefaces and tables of contents.","p4":"Roman numerals follow strict formation rules: never use more than three consecutive identical symbols (except M), and only I, X, and C can be used in subtractive pairs. Valid subtractive combinations are IV (4), IX (9), XL (40), XC (90), CD (400), and CM (900) — other combinations like VL or IC are incorrect. The upper limit of 3999 exists because Romans didn't have a single symbol for 5000, and numbers beyond that used bars over symbols or other special notation not widely standardized. When reading old inscriptions, remember that IIII for 4 appears on some clock faces instead of IV due to aesthetic symmetry preferences."},"power-converter":{"p2":"Enter your power value in any unit including Watts, kilowatts, megawatts, horsepower (mechanical), PS (metric horsepower), BTU per hour, or foot-pounds per second. The tool displays instant conversions across all units, letting you compare electrical power in watts against mechanical power in horsepower or thermal power in BTU/h. This makes it simple to translate specifications from different industries or regions that prefer different units. All calculations run locally in your browser for fast, private conversions without server uploads.","p3":"Automotive engineers convert engine power ratings between horsepower and kilowatts when comparing American and European vehicle specifications or meeting regulatory labeling requirements. HVAC contractors translate air conditioner cooling capacity from BTU/h to kilowatts when calculating electrical load for building power systems. Industrial equipment buyers compare motor specifications listed in different units — converting PS to HP or kW depending on manufacturer origin. Solar installers calculate whether a home's peak consumption in kilowatts can be met by available roof space for panel installation.","p4":"Note that mechanical horsepower (745.7W) differs slightly from metric horsepower or PS (735.5W) — always specify which type you're using in technical documentation. BTU per hour measures thermal power, but one BTU/h equals only about 0.293 watts, making it much smaller than you might expect. When sizing generators or electrical circuits, remember to account for power factor — apparent power in VA differs from real power in watts. For continuous loads like motors or heaters, circuit breakers should be rated for at least 125% of the load's power draw to prevent nuisance tripping."},"gradient-generator":{"p2":"Choose your gradient type — linear, radial, or conic — then click to add color stops along the gradient path. Drag each stop to adjust its position, and click the color swatch to pick your desired hue using the built-in color picker. For linear gradients, rotate the angle slider to control direction from 0° (bottom to top) through 180° (top to bottom). Radial gradients let you center focus, while conic gradients create color wheel effects. Copy the complete CSS code with one click and paste it directly into your stylesheet or inline styles.","p3":"Web designers create hero section backgrounds with subtle two-tone gradients that add depth without overwhelming content. UI developers build button hover states using linear gradients from lighter to darker shades for visual feedback. Marketing teams design eye-catching call-to-action banners with vibrant multi-stop gradients that draw attention on landing pages. Mobile app designers use radial gradients to create spotlight effects that guide users' eyes toward important interface elements or promotional content.","p4":"Limit gradients to 2-4 color stops for clean, professional results — too many colors create muddy transitions. When designing for readability, ensure sufficient contrast between gradient and overlaid text by testing at both extremes of the color range. For subtle depth effects, use gradients between shades of the same hue rather than jumping between different colors. Radial gradients with positioned centers (using at x% y% syntax) create dramatic spotlight effects perfect for hero sections. Export your favorite gradients as CSS custom properties to maintain consistency across components and enable theme switching."},"palette-generator":{"p2":"Pick your base color using the color picker or enter a hex value, then select one of six color harmony rules: complementary for high contrast, analogous for smooth transitions, triadic for balanced vibrancy, split-complementary for sophisticated contrast, tetradic for complex schemes, or monochromatic for elegant single-hue variations. The generator instantly displays your palette with all color values shown in hex, RGB, and HSL formats. Click any color to copy its value, or use the lock feature to preserve colors while regenerating the rest. Processing happens entirely in your browser using color theory mathematics.","p3":"Brand designers establishing visual identity systems use triadic or tetradic schemes to create comprehensive palettes with primary, secondary, and accent colors for logos, marketing materials, and digital properties. Interior designers rely on analogous palettes when selecting paint, fabrics, and decor that harmonize naturally within a room. Web developers building dark mode interfaces use monochromatic schemes from a base color to generate consistent shades for backgrounds, panels, and UI elements. Presentation creators employ complementary schemes to make key data points pop against slide backgrounds without clashing.","p4":"Complementary colors (opposite on the color wheel) provide maximum contrast but can vibrate unpleasantly when placed side-by-side at full saturation — reduce intensity for better balance. Analogous schemes work best when you designate one color as dominant and use the others as accents in 60-30-10 proportions. Triadic palettes feel most balanced when one color dominates while the other two serve supporting roles. Before finalizing any palette, test it with the contrast checker to ensure text legibility meets WCAG standards. Export successful palettes as CSS variables or design tokens to maintain consistency across your entire project."},"contrast-checker":{"p2":"Select your foreground (text) color and background color using the color pickers or by entering hex codes directly. The tool immediately calculates the WCAG contrast ratio and displays pass/fail results for four different criteria: Level AA normal text (4.5:1), Level AA large text (3:1), Level AAA normal text (7:1), and Level AAA large text (4.5:1). Large text means 18pt and above, or 14pt and above when bold. All calculations use the official WCAG 2.1 formula and run entirely in your browser for instant feedback.","p3":"Web developers ensure their site text meets legal accessibility requirements before launching, avoiding potential lawsuits under ADA or Section 508 regulations. UI designers verify that call-to-action buttons have sufficient contrast against page backgrounds so users with low vision can easily identify interactive elements. Mobile app developers test whether their light mode and dark mode color schemes both pass AA standards for users in different lighting conditions. Government agencies building public-facing websites must meet AAA standards in many jurisdictions, requiring careful color selection validated through contrast checking.","p4":"Always aim for Level AA compliance at minimum — many countries legally require it for government and commercial websites. Level AAA provides better accessibility but can be challenging with brand colors; prioritize it for body text while AA may suffice for decorative elements. Remember that contrast requirements differ for large text (18pt+ regular or 14pt+ bold) versus normal text. Contrast ratios apply to all text-on-background scenarios including text over images, so test overlay combinations carefully. When using light text on colored backgrounds, pure white often works better than off-white since every step away from white reduces contrast."},"box-shadow-generator":{"p2":"Add your first shadow layer with the plus button, then adjust horizontal offset (X), vertical offset (Y), blur radius, and spread using the sliders or direct input. Pick your shadow color and set its opacity using the alpha slider. Toggle between outer shadows (default) and inset shadows for inner glow effects. Add multiple shadow layers to create complex depth effects — each layer stacks on top of previous ones. Preview updates instantly as you adjust any parameter, and the CSS output reflects your complete shadow declaration ready to copy into your stylesheets.","p3":"Card-based UI designers add subtle shadows to elevate content cards above page backgrounds, creating hierarchy that guides users through information architecture. E-commerce sites use pronounced shadows on product images and 'Add to Cart' buttons to make them appear tactile and clickable. Dashboard builders layer multiple shadows with different blur radii to achieve realistic material design depth levels — one sharp shadow for definition plus a softer shadow for ambient lighting. Creative agencies design dramatic hover effects by animating shadow properties, making interface elements appear to lift off the page when users interact.","p4":"Layer shadows from largest/softest (bottom) to smallest/sharpest (top) to mimic natural lighting where ambient light creates soft shadows and direct light creates defined edges. Keep spread values minimal (0-4px) — excessive spread makes shadows look artificial and cartoon-like. For realistic depth, position the main shadow slightly below and to the right (positive X and Y) simulating light from upper-left, a convention users expect. Inset shadows work beautifully for input fields to create recessed appearances. Use semi-transparent black (rgba(0,0,0,0.1-0.3)) for most shadows rather than pure black, which looks harsh."},"border-radius-generator":{"p2":"Use the corner control toggles to work with all four corners linked together for uniform rounding, or unlink them to set each corner independently. Drag the slider or type values directly, then choose your preferred unit: pixels for fixed sizing, percentages for responsive scaling, or rems for accessibility-friendly sizing that respects user font preferences. The preview box updates in real-time showing exactly how your element will appear. Copy the generated CSS with a single click — it includes the full border-radius property with individual corner values when they differ.","p3":"Button designers round corners to create friendly, approachable interface elements that feel more touchable than harsh rectangular edges. Card layouts use subtle radius (4-8px) on content containers for modern, polished aesthetics that distinguish sections without heavy borders. Profile pictures and avatar components use 50% border-radius to transform square images into perfect circles. Design systems implement consistent radius scales (2px, 4px, 8px, 16px) across components to maintain visual harmony, and this tool helps visualize each step of that scale.","p4":"Setting border-radius to 50% creates a perfect circle only when the element has equal width and height — use this for avatar images. For pill-shaped buttons, use a radius equal to half the button's height (if height is 40px, use 20px radius). When applying different radii to individual corners, maintain visual balance by keeping opposite corners similar. Percentage-based radius scales with element size, making it ideal for responsive components that resize at different breakpoints. Combining border-radius with overflow: hidden clips child content cleanly, essential when rounding containers with background images or nested elements."},"glassmorphism-generator":{"p2":"Adjust the blur slider to control how much background content shows through your glass element — higher values create stronger frosting effects. Set background opacity to determine translucency, color saturation to add tint (making your glass warmer or cooler), and border transparency for the characteristic subtle edge highlight. The preview displays your glass card against a customizable gradient background so you can see exactly how it interacts with content behind it. Copy the complete CSS including backdrop-filter, background, and border properties ready for production use. All rendering happens in your browser.","p3":"Dashboard interfaces use glassmorphic panels to layer information over dynamic backgrounds like video or animated gradients while maintaining readability. Mobile app designers create frosted navigation bars and modals that let underlying content peek through, maintaining context while focusing attention on foreground elements. Landing pages employ glass cards for pricing tables or feature highlights, adding sophisticated depth that feels premium and modern. Music player interfaces use glassmorphism for playback controls overlaying album artwork, creating visual cohesion between UI and content.","p4":"Backdrop-filter blur works best between 10-20px — lower values barely frost while higher values make glass opaque. Always include a semi-transparent background fallback for browsers without backdrop-filter support, particularly older Firefox versions. Glassmorphism looks most striking against vibrant or multicolored backgrounds; subtle backgrounds reduce visual impact. Add a thin bright border (1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.18)) to define edges against busy backgrounds. Performance tip: backdrop-filter is GPU-intensive, so limit use to hero sections or key UI elements rather than applying throughout entire layouts."},"animation-generator":{"p2":"Select one of eight preset animation effects: bounce, fade-in, slide-in (from top/right/bottom/left), rotate, pulse, shake, zoom-in, or flip. Set your animation duration in seconds, choose a timing function (linear, ease, ease-in, ease-out, or ease-in-out) that controls acceleration, and specify iteration count (once, twice, or infinite loop). The preview box demonstrates your animation continuously so you can fine-tune timing and feel before committing. Copy both the CSS class and @keyframes rule together — paste both into your stylesheet and apply the class to any element.","p3":"Marketing landing pages use fade-in animations on hero text and call-to-action buttons to grab attention as users scroll into view. E-commerce product pages employ subtle zoom-in effects on images during hover states to invite interaction without being jarring. Loading screens use infinite pulse or rotate animations to indicate processing without requiring actual progress data. Onboarding flows slide-in tutorial cards sequentially to guide new users through features without overwhelming them all at once.","p4":"Match timing functions to animation intent: ease-out for elements entering the viewport (fast start, slow finish feels natural), ease-in for elements exiting (accelerate away), and ease-in-out for looping animations. Keep durations short (0.3-0.6s) for UI feedback, longer (0.8-1.2s) for decorative effects — anything over 2s feels sluggish. Infinite iterations work for loading indicators but exhaust users on content elements; use sparingly. Combine animation-delay with animation-fill-mode: forwards to create staggered sequences where elements animate one after another. Test on low-end devices since complex keyframe animations can cause jank on slower GPUs."},"clip-path-generator":{"p2":"Choose from eight shape presets: circle, ellipse, inset rectangle, triangle, pentagon, hexagon, star, or arrow. Each shape offers adjustable parameters via sliders — circle and ellipse let you control size and position, inset adjusts how much to cut from each edge, and polygon shapes have point-specific controls. The preview updates instantly showing exactly how your shape will mask content. Copy the generated clip-path CSS property and apply it to any element to crop it to your custom shape. Everything processes locally for privacy.","p3":"Hero sections use clipped diagonal edges created with polygon clip-paths to break away from rectangular monotony and create dynamic page transitions between sections. Profile pictures get creative shapes beyond simple circles — hexagons for tech brands, stars for gaming sites, or custom polygons for unique branding. Image galleries clip hover overlays into interesting shapes that reveal portions of underlying images for interactive exploration. Infographic designers use clip-path to create custom callout shapes, badges, and ribbon effects that pure CSS rectangles can't achieve.","p4":"Clip-path cuts content but doesn't affect layout — the element still occupies its full rectangular box, so plan spacing accordingly. For responsive designs, use percentage-based inset values rather than fixed pixels so shapes scale with container size. Remember that clip-path clips both the element and its background but not box-shadow, which can create unexpected visual artifacts. Complex polygon shapes with many points can hurt performance; simplify to the minimum points needed. Combine clip-path with transitions to create morphing effects between shapes on hover or state changes."},"flexbox-generator":{"p2":"Configure container properties using the visual controls: flex-direction switches between row and column layouts, flex-wrap determines whether items stay on one line or wrap to multiple lines, justify-content aligns items along the main axis, align-items positions them on the cross axis, and gap sets spacing between flex children. Add or remove preview items to see how your layout adapts to different content quantities. The live preview updates instantly as you adjust each property, and the generated CSS shows both the container and item rules ready to copy into your project.","p3":"Navigation bars use flexbox with space-between justification to push logo left and menu items right without manual positioning calculations. Card grids employ flex-wrap with gap spacing to create responsive galleries that automatically reflow at different screen widths without media queries. Form layouts utilize flex-direction: column for mobile and switch to row for desktop to stack labels above inputs on small screens. Dashboard widgets align icons and text using align-items: center to vertically center content regardless of varying text heights or icon sizes.","p4":"Start with justify-content for main axis alignment (horizontal in row, vertical in column) and align-items for cross axis — this mental model prevents confusion. Use gap instead of margins on flex children for spacing since it won't add extra space at container edges. flex-wrap: wrap enables responsive behavior without media queries when combined with flex-basis or min-width on children. Remember that align-content only affects multi-line flex containers, not single lines. For equal-width columns, set flex: 1 on children; for content-based sizing, use flex: 0 1 auto to prevent shrinking."},"color-blindness-simulator":{"p2":"Upload an image or select colors from your design palette, then choose which type of color vision deficiency to simulate: protanopia (red-blindness), deuteranopia (green-blindness), tritanopia (blue-blindness), protanomaly (reduced red sensitivity), deuteranomaly (reduced green sensitivity), or tritanomaly (reduced blue sensitivity). The tool applies mathematical transformations that accurately model how these conditions affect color perception. Compare the simulated view side-by-side with the original to identify problematic color combinations that would be indistinguishable to affected users. All processing happens locally in your browser for privacy.","p3":"UI designers test whether critical interface elements like error states (traditionally red) and success messages (typically green) remain distinguishable to colorblind users before finalizing designs. Data visualization specialists verify that chart colors, graph lines, and heat maps communicate information through patterns or labels in addition to color coding. Infographic creators ensure icons, callouts, and category distinctions don't rely solely on color differences that disappear under color vision deficiency. Game developers test whether gameplay mechanics dependent on color recognition (like wire matching or enemy identification) remain playable for colorblind players.","p4":"Deuteranomaly (reduced green sensitivity) affects roughly 6% of males and is the most common form — always test against this variant at minimum. Avoid red-green combinations entirely since protanopia and deuteranopia both confuse these hues; use blue-orange pairings instead for better accessibility. Don't rely on color alone to convey information — supplement with patterns, shapes, icons, or text labels. Tools like this simulator aren't perfect since they approximate rather than replicate the actual experience, but they catch most major issues. Combine simulation testing with contrast ratio checking for comprehensive accessibility validation."},"palette-from-image":{"p2":"Upload any image from your device by clicking the upload area or dragging and dropping a file. The tool analyzes pixel data using k-means clustering algorithms to identify the most dominant and representative colors in your image, extracting typically 5-8 key hues that capture the image's color essence. Each extracted color displays with its hex code, and you can click any swatch to copy the value instantly. This makes it effortless to build color schemes inspired by photographs, artwork, or brand imagery. All image processing happens in your browser — files never upload to any server.","p3":"Brand designers extract palettes from product photography to ensure website color schemes harmonize perfectly with hero images and product shots. Interior decorators upload room photos to identify existing colors in furniture and decor, then build complementary schemes for walls and accents. Social media managers create branded graphics by extracting colors from company logos or campaign photography to maintain consistent visual identity across posts. Web developers building themes for photography portfolios extract palettes from featured images to create cohesive layouts where UI colors complement rather than clash with content.","p4":"Images with many colors may extract muddy or overly similar shades — for cleaner palettes, upload images with distinct color regions or limited palettes to begin with. The algorithm weights colors by area, so dominant background colors appear more prominently than small accent details. Crop your image before uploading to focus on specific color regions if you want a palette from just part of the image. Lighting affects extracted colors significantly; an outdoor photo in golden hour yields warmer tones than the same scene in midday light. Combine extracted palettes with the harmony generator to expand beyond literal image colors into complementary schemes."},"font-pair-suggester":{"p2":"Browse curated font pairings organized by style categories like elegant, modern, classic, bold, and minimal. Each suggestion displays a heading in the primary font paired with body text in the complementary font, letting you see exactly how the combination looks together. Click any pairing to view Google Fonts links for both typefaces, ready to add to your project via the standard link tag or CSS import. Adjust the preview text to see how your actual content would appear in each pairing. Filter by style mood to match your project's aesthetic goals, with all recommendations based on proven typographic principles.","p3":"Website designers establishing visual hierarchy pair a distinctive heading font with a readable body font to create interest without sacrificing legibility. Brand identity projects match serif headings with sans-serif body text (or vice versa) to balance traditional and modern aesthetics. Portfolio sites use bold display fonts for project titles paired with neutral body fonts that keep focus on work samples. Marketing materials combine script or decorative headers with clean sans-serifs for body copy to add personality while maintaining professional readability.","p4":"Contrast is key: pair serif with sans-serif, condensed with wide, heavy with light — similar fonts compete rather than complement. Limit projects to 2-3 typefaces maximum; more creates visual chaos and hurts performance with additional font file downloads. When pairing, ensure x-heights (the height of lowercase letters) are similar so body text and headings feel cohesive at different sizes. Google Fonts suggests popular pairings based on actual usage data from millions of websites, making these combinations battle-tested. Always load font-display: swap to prevent invisible text during load, especially on slower connections."},"css-pattern-generator":{"p2":"Select your pattern type from six options: stripes (vertical or horizontal), dots, grid, checkerboard, zigzag, or diagonal. Adjust pattern size using the slider to control spacing between repeating elements, then pick your two pattern colors (foreground and background). The preview updates in real-time showing how your pattern tiles across a surface. Fine-tune the pattern density and color contrast until you achieve your desired visual effect. Copy the generated CSS background property with one click — it uses linear-gradient or radial-gradient functions that create pure CSS patterns without image files, keeping your site fast and scalable.","p3":"Landing pages use subtle dot or grid patterns on hero section backgrounds to add texture without overwhelming primary content. Dashboard interfaces employ light checkerboard or stripe patterns in data table rows for improved readability by visually separating rows. Portfolio sites create dynamic diagonal stripe backgrounds for section dividers that add energy and guide the eye down the page. E-commerce product cards use understated background patterns to differentiate categories or sales items while maintaining a cohesive design language.","p4":"Keep background patterns subtle by using low-contrast color pairs (10-15% difference in lightness) to avoid competing with foreground content. Smaller pattern sizes (8-16px) feel more refined while larger sizes (32px+) appear bold and graphic — match to your brand personality. Patterns created with CSS gradients perform better than background images since there's no HTTP request or file to download. Combine patterns with background-blend-mode for sophisticated overlay effects on images. Test patterns at different screen sizes since small repeating elements may create moiré patterns or vibration on high-DPI displays."},"youtube-thumbnail":{"p2":"Paste any YouTube video URL into the input field — you can use the full watch URL, the shortened youtu.be link, or just the video ID. The tool extracts the video identifier and displays all available thumbnail versions: maxresdefault (1280×720 HD), sddefault (640×480 standard), hqdefault (480×360 high quality), and mqdefault (320×180 medium quality). Click the download button under your preferred resolution to save the thumbnail image directly to your device. Not all videos have maxresdefault available; older or low-quality uploads may only offer lower resolutions. All processing happens in your browser without uploading data to any third-party servers.","p3":"Content creators download competitor thumbnails to analyze what visual strategies work in their niche before designing their own eye-catching thumbnails. Video editors need reference images when creating custom thumbnails, using the original auto-generated thumbnail as a base layer. Social media managers repurpose YouTube video thumbnails for promotion on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook where embedded videos don't display properly. Students and researchers document video content by saving thumbnails as visual references in presentations or academic papers when screenshots aren't sufficient.","p4":"Always try downloading maxresdefault first for the highest quality, but be aware that many older videos don't have this resolution available. YouTube automatically generates three timestamps for thumbnails (25%, 50%, 75% through the video), but creators can upload custom thumbnails — what you download may be either auto-generated or custom. Thumbnails are public and not subject to video privacy settings, so even unlisted videos have accessible thumbnails. If maxres returns a black image or fails, fall back to sddefault which is more reliably available across all videos. Downloaded thumbnails retain YouTube's 16:9 aspect ratio, perfect for reuse in video projects or social media posts."},"youtube-money-calculator":{"p2":"Enter your estimated daily view count and expected CPM (cost per thousand views) rate. CPM varies widely by niche, geography, and audience demographics — typical ranges are $0.25-$4 for developing markets, $2-$8 for general content in developed markets, and $8-$20+ for finance, business, or tech channels. The calculator multiplies your daily views by CPM and applies YouTube's 55/45 revenue split (creators get 55%) to estimate daily, monthly, and yearly earnings. Adjust inputs to model growth scenarios or compare different CPM assumptions. All calculations happen locally in your browser.","p3":"Aspiring YouTubers research realistic income expectations by calculating earnings at various view count milestones before deciding whether to pursue content creation full-time. Existing creators validate whether their actual AdSense revenue aligns with industry benchmarks or indicates they should optimize for higher-CPM content. Brands evaluating influencer partnerships estimate a channel's revenue to determine fair sponsorship rates relative to a creator's ad income. Financial advisors helping content creator clients model income streams and tax planning using view count trends and CPM averages.","p4":"CPM varies dramatically by content type: finance and business average $12-$25, tech and gadgets $7-$15, gaming and entertainment $2-$6, and vlogs or lifestyle $1-$5. Geography matters — US traffic commands 3-5x higher CPM than traffic from developing nations. YouTube takes 45% of ad revenue, so a $10 CPM means you actually earn $5.50 per thousand views. RPM (revenue per thousand) shown in YouTube Analytics already accounts for the 55/45 split and is lower than CPM. Factor in that only 40-60% of views are monetized due to ad blockers and viewers in non-monetizable countries."},"youtube-embed-generator":{"p2":"Paste your YouTube video URL, then configure embed options using the checkboxes and inputs: enable autoplay to start video immediately on page load, set loop to replay infinitely, mute audio by default (required for autoplay on most browsers), specify a start time in seconds to skip intros, hide video controls for cleaner embeds, and toggle responsive mode to generate fluid-width CSS. The tool builds the proper iframe embed code with all your options encoded as URL parameters. Copy the complete HTML and paste it into your webpage. All code generation happens in your browser.","p3":"Landing pages embed product demo videos with autoplay and mute enabled to create silent background video heroes that grab attention without disrupting the browsing experience. Blog posts embed tutorial videos with specific start times that skip intros and jump straight to the relevant instruction. Portfolio websites use hidden controls and loop settings for ambient background videos that play continuously without UI clutter. Online courses embed lecture videos with responsive sizing so they adapt properly to students watching on phones, tablets, or desktop computers.","p4":"Autoplay with sound only works when users have interacted with your site first — browsers block it otherwise to prevent annoying experiences. Always combine autoplay with mute to ensure reliable playback. The rel=0 parameter that once removed related videos no longer works; YouTube now only shows related videos from the same channel at video end. Start time uses seconds, not timestamps — for 1:30, enter 90 seconds. Responsive embeds require wrapper divs with specific aspect ratio CSS; copy the provided code exactly. Privacy-enhanced mode (using youtube-nocookie.com) prevents YouTube from tracking viewers until they play the video."},"youtube-seo-generator":{"p2":"Enter a single keyword or phrase that represents your video's core topic. The generator analyzes your keyword and produces four optimized elements: a list of related tags to add in YouTube Studio for better discoverability, trending hashtags to include in your description for social reach, an engaging video title that balances keywords with clickability, and a complete description template with keyword placement, CTAs, and structure. Edit any generated element to match your voice or add specific details. Copy each section independently or grab everything at once to paste into your video upload form.","p3":"New YouTubers optimize their first uploads by generating comprehensive SEO metadata from simple topic keywords, learning best practices through the template structure. Established creators streamline their upload workflow by quickly generating tag lists and description frameworks instead of manually brainstorming variations each time. Series creators maintain consistent SEO patterns across episodes by using the same seed keyword to generate cohesive tags and titles. Content repurposers translate video topics into text metadata when uploading clips from streams, podcasts, or presentations where metadata wasn't pre-planned.","p4":"Place your primary keyword in the first 100 characters of your description where it has the most SEO weight — YouTube's algorithm weighs early text heavily. Mix broad tags (\"photography\") with specific long-tail tags (\"landscape photography tutorial for beginners\") to rank in both competitive and niche searches. Limit hashtags to 3-5 relevant ones; more than 15 causes YouTube to ignore all of them. Front-load your title with keywords but end with intrigue or benefit to maintain click-through rate. Refresh tags quarterly based on YouTube Studio analytics to see which search terms actually drive views, then optimize around high performers."},"youtube-channel-name-generator":{"p2":"Type your channel niche (like \"cooking,\" \"gaming,\" \"finance\") and add relevant keywords that describe your content style or unique angle. Click generate to receive 20 creative name suggestions that blend your inputs with common YouTube naming patterns — combining descriptive words with channel archetypes like \"Academy,\" \"Hub,\" \"Lab,\" or \"Studio.\" Each name attempts to balance discoverability (using searchable keywords) with memorability (keeping it short and catchy). Regenerate for fresh ideas or mix-and-match elements from different suggestions. All generation happens in your browser without storing your keywords.","p3":"Aspiring creators brainstorm channel identities before uploading their first video, testing different name styles to see what resonates with their planned content. Rebranchers who've outgrown a niche-specific name explore broader alternatives that allow content diversification without confusing subscribers. Multi-channel entrepreneurs quickly generate names for secondary channels in different niches without spending hours in naming paralysis. Brand managers launching official YouTube presence for companies explore name variations that connect corporate identity with YouTube culture.","p4":"Shorter names (1-2 words, under 20 characters) are more memorable and easier to say in video outros when asking for subscriptions. Avoid numbers and special characters that complicate verbal sharing — \"Tech Tips 4 U\" is harder to communicate than \"TechTips\" or \"TechieTalk.\" Check domain availability even if you don't plan a website initially; matching .com builds credibility later. Search your shortlist on YouTube before committing to ensure you're not too similar to existing major channels. Avoid hyper-specific niche names that limit future content evolution — \"DroneRacingOnly\" boxes you in while \"AerialAdventures\" allows growth."},"youtube-watch-time-calculator":{"p2":"Enter individual video durations in hours, minutes, and seconds format (like 1:23:45 or 12:30), or paste a YouTube playlist URL to automatically pull all video lengths. Click calculate to see total watch time at standard 1x speed and at four faster speeds: 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75x, and 2x playback. The tool displays results in hours and minutes, showing exactly how much clock time you'll spend watching the content at each speed. Add or remove videos to model different viewing scenarios. All calculations happen in your browser without sending your playlist data anywhere.","p3":"Students with online lecture playlists calculate time commitments for exam preparation, discovering they can watch a 10-hour course in just 5 hours at 2x speed. Online course consumers preview total time investment before purchasing lengthy video courses to ensure they fit learning goals into busy schedules. Podcast listeners converting to YouTube video versions estimate realistic completion times when binging entire series. Conference attendees catching up on recorded talks calculate whether they can finish sessions before early-bird ticket deadlines by adjusting playback speed.","p4":"Most people can comfortably comprehend 1.5x speed after a brief adjustment period, saving 33% of watch time with minimal comprehension loss. Technical content with dense information works better at 1.25x, while casual vlogs or entertainment can handle 2x. YouTube Premium is required for background playback and app-based speed controls on mobile; browser viewers can always adjust speed. Certain content types like music performances or cinematography-focused videos shouldn't be sped up as it degrades the experience. Combine speed watching with chapter markers or timestamps to skip irrelevant sections entirely for maximum time efficiency."},"youtube-video-analyzer":{"p2":"Paste any public YouTube video URL into the analyzer. The tool fetches complete metadata using the YouTube API: view count, like count, comment count, video duration, upload date, video description, tags, category, channel name, and subscriber count. All metrics display in an easy-to-read format with key performance indicators highlighted. Use this data to understand video performance, reverse-engineer successful content strategies, or gather competitive intelligence. No login or API key required — the tool handles authentication. All requests happen through your browser.","p3":"Content creators analyze viral videos in their niche to identify patterns in titles, tags, descriptions, and metadata that correlate with high performance. Marketing agencies conduct competitive research on client competitors by examining their top-performing videos, publishing schedules, and engagement metrics. Journalists researching online trends extract metadata from newsworthy videos for reporting without manually noting stats. SEO specialists reverse-engineer tag strategies from successful videos to inform their own optimization approaches.","p4":"Views, likes, and comments update continuously, so metrics may differ from what you see on the video page depending on when you analyze. Older videos may have hidden like counts due to creator privacy settings — the analyzer can only show what YouTube's API provides. Tags are often the most valuable SEO insight since they're hidden on the video page but retrievable via API; model your tagging strategy on successful similar videos. Duration affects algorithm recommendations; videos between 8-15 minutes hit a sweet spot for watch time without overwhelming viewers. Check upload date to contextualize metrics — 100k views in one week is viral, while 100k over five years is not."},"youtube-channel-analyzer":{"p2":"Enter any YouTube channel URL or channel ID. The analyzer pulls comprehensive channel statistics via the YouTube API: total subscriber count, cumulative view count across all videos, total number of published videos, channel creation date, and calculated average views per video. Some channels hide subscriber counts for privacy; the tool displays this when available. Use the metrics to evaluate channel growth, benchmark your performance against competitors, or research potential collaboration partners. No authentication needed — just paste the URL and analyze. All processing happens in your browser.","p3":"Aspiring creators research established channels in their niche to set realistic growth expectations and understand how video quantity relates to subscriber counts. Brands vetting influencer partnerships verify subscriber claims and evaluate engagement rates by comparing subscribers to average views per video. Talent agents scouting content creators identify rising channels with strong view-to-subscriber ratios indicating high engagement and growth potential. Competitive analysts track competitor channel stats over time to monitor market share shifts in content niches.","p4":"Average views per video matters more than subscriber count — a channel with 10k subs averaging 15k views has better engagement than 100k subs averaging 2k views, indicating active audience or viral content. Channel age contexturalizes subscriber counts; 100k subs in one year is explosive growth while 100k over ten years is modest. Some channels buy subscribers, visible when subscriber count vastly exceeds view counts (ratio should be roughly 1:10 to 1:20 for healthy channels). Compare total views to video count to estimate effort required for similar results in your niche. Hidden subscriber counts often indicate smaller channels sensitive about appearing small or very large creators avoiding scrutiny."}}
