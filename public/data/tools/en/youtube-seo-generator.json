{"p2":"Enter a single keyword or phrase that represents your video's core topic. The generator analyzes your keyword and produces four optimized elements: a list of related tags to add in YouTube Studio for better discoverability, trending hashtags to include in your description for social reach, an engaging video title that balances keywords with clickability, and a complete description template with keyword placement, CTAs, and structure. Edit any generated element to match your voice or add specific details. Copy each section independently or grab everything at once to paste into your video upload form.","p3":"New YouTubers optimize their first uploads by generating comprehensive SEO metadata from simple topic keywords, learning best practices through the template structure. Established creators streamline their upload workflow by quickly generating tag lists and description frameworks instead of manually brainstorming variations each time. Series creators maintain consistent SEO patterns across episodes by using the same seed keyword to generate cohesive tags and titles. Content repurposers translate video topics into text metadata when uploading clips from streams, podcasts, or presentations where metadata wasn't pre-planned.","p4":"Place your primary keyword in the first 100 characters of your description where it has the most SEO weight — YouTube's algorithm weighs early text heavily. Mix broad tags (\"photography\") with specific long-tail tags (\"landscape photography tutorial for beginners\") to rank in both competitive and niche searches. Limit hashtags to 3-5 relevant ones; more than 15 causes YouTube to ignore all of them. Front-load your title with keywords but end with intrigue or benefit to maintain click-through rate. Refresh tags quarterly based on YouTube Studio analytics to see which search terms actually drive views, then optimize around high performers."}
