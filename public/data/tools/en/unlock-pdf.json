{"p2":"Upload a password-protected PDF and if you have the correct password, the tool removes restrictions that prevent printing, copying, or editing. Some PDFs have user passwords (required to open the file) while others have owner passwords (that restrict permissions)—this tool handles both types when credentials are provided. The unlocking process strips security metadata and creates an unrestricted copy of the document. All processing occurs locally in your browser, so documents containing confidential information remain on your device and passwords aren't transmitted to any server during the unlock operation.","p3":"Remote workers unlock company PDF documents received with outdated passwords to enable copying text for reports after the original document creator left the organization. Researchers remove printing restrictions from archived journal articles to create physical reference copies for offline study. Legal assistants unlock case file PDFs to enable text selection and copying when extracting quotes for briefs and motions. Small business owners remove editing restrictions from vendor-supplied PDF forms to customize fields and branding for their specific operations. Archivists unlock historical PDF documents where original passwords are documented in institutional records but restrictions prevent digital preservation workflows.","p4":"This tool only removes restrictions from PDFs where you already have access—it cannot crack or bypass unknown passwords, which would violate security protections. If you frequently receive protected documents from the same source, request unrestricted versions to avoid repetitive unlocking. Before unlocking documents for editing, verify you have legal authority to modify them since some restrictions are intentionally placed to prevent unauthorized changes. Save unlocked versions under clearly labeled filenames to distinguish them from the original protected copies. Remember that removing protection doesn't enhance document quality or repair corrupted files—it only eliminates access restrictions."}
