{"p2":"Paste any public YouTube video URL into the analyzer. The tool fetches complete metadata using the YouTube API: view count, like count, comment count, video duration, upload date, video description, tags, category, channel name, and subscriber count. All metrics display in an easy-to-read format with key performance indicators highlighted. Use this data to understand video performance, reverse-engineer successful content strategies, or gather competitive intelligence. No login or API key required — the tool handles authentication. All requests happen through your browser.","p3":"Content creators analyze viral videos in their niche to identify patterns in titles, tags, descriptions, and metadata that correlate with high performance. Marketing agencies conduct competitive research on client competitors by examining their top-performing videos, publishing schedules, and engagement metrics. Journalists researching online trends extract metadata from newsworthy videos for reporting without manually noting stats. SEO specialists reverse-engineer tag strategies from successful videos to inform their own optimization approaches.","p4":"Views, likes, and comments update continuously, so metrics may differ from what you see on the video page depending on when you analyze. Older videos may have hidden like counts due to creator privacy settings — the analyzer can only show what YouTube's API provides. Tags are often the most valuable SEO insight since they're hidden on the video page but retrievable via API; model your tagging strategy on successful similar videos. Duration affects algorithm recommendations; videos between 8-15 minutes hit a sweet spot for watch time without overwhelming viewers. Check upload date to contextualize metrics — 100k views in one week is viral, while 100k over five years is not."}
