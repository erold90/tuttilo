{"p2":"Upload your PDF file and Tuttilo's compression engine analyzes each page to identify opportunities for size reduction. The tool applies intelligent optimization to images, fonts, and embedded content while preserving text clarity and visual fidelity. You can choose between different compression levels depending on whether you prioritize file size or maximum quality. Since everything runs in your browser, sensitive documents like financial reports or legal contracts never reach external servers, ensuring complete privacy during the compression process.","p3":"Students frequently use this tool to compress research papers and thesis drafts before submitting them through university portals with strict file size limits. Marketing professionals rely on it to shrink presentation materials and product catalogs for email distribution without exceeding attachment size restrictions. Real estate agents compress property brochures and listing documents to ensure fast loading times when sharing portfolios with clients. Legal departments use it to reduce the size of contract bundles and case files before uploading to court e-filing systems that impose strict size caps.","p4":"For optimal results, compress PDFs that contain high-resolution photos or scanned images, where size reductions of 60-80% are common. Documents with primarily text and vector graphics may see smaller improvements since they're already efficiently stored. Avoid compressing the same file multiple times, as quality degradation compounds with each pass. If you need to preserve exact color fidelity for professional printing, test a sample page first before compressing an entire document. Consider creating two versions—a compressed one for digital distribution and an uncompressed master for archival purposes."}
