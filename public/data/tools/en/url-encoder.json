{"p2":"Paste a URL or text containing special characters into the input field and select Encode to convert reserved characters into percent-encoded format (%20 for space, %3A for colon, etc.). The encoded output is safe to use in URLs, query parameters, and API requests without breaking parsing logic. Select Decode to reverse the process, converting percent-encoded strings back to readable text. The tool correctly handles UTF-8 characters, encoding them as multiple percent-encoded bytes. Processing happens instantly in your browser using native JavaScript encodeURIComponent and decodeURIComponent functions.","p3":"Web developers encoding query parameters containing spaces, ampersands, or special characters ensure URLs work correctly across browsers. API engineers decode error messages or response URLs that come back percent-encoded to read the actual content. Backend programmers validate that their URL generation code produces correctly encoded links before deploying to production. Frontend developers debug broken links by checking whether special characters in user-generated URLs need encoding.","p4":"Encode entire URLs differently than individual components: use encodeURIComponent for query parameters and form data, but don't encode the protocol or slashes in the base URL itself or you'll break the link structure. Forward slashes and colons are valid in the main URL but need encoding if they appear in query parameter values. When decoding, be cautious of double-encoded data; accidentally decoding twice can produce incorrect results. Test encoded URLs by pasting them in a browser to verify they work before using them programmatically.","seo":"Encode or decode URLs and URI components instantly. Converts special characters to percent-encoded format and back. Essential tool for web development and API work."}
