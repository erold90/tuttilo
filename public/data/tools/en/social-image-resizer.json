{"p2":"Upload your image using the file picker, then select your target platform and format from the preset list covering Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and YouTube. The tool crops or scales your image to exact pixel dimensions required by that platform while maintaining aspect ratio. Preview the resized result before downloading to ensure important elements aren't cut off. All image processing happens in your browser using canvas manipulation, so your photos never upload to external servers. Download the optimized image and upload it directly to your chosen social platform for perfect display.","p3":"Social media managers prepare campaign visuals across multiple platforms without manually calculating dimensions for each. Influencers resize personal photos to fit Instagram's square posts, portrait stories, and landscape feed requirements in one workflow. Marketing teams create Facebook ad creatives that meet the platform's recommended sizes for optimal delivery and engagement. Content creators repurpose YouTube thumbnails for Twitter headers or LinkedIn banners by quickly generating correctly sized variants.","p4":"Design your original image larger than your largest needed dimension so you're always scaling down rather than up, which preserves quality. Leave important text and faces toward the center of compositions since different aspect ratios crop differently from edges. Use the preview feature to verify critical elements like logos and call-to-action text remain visible after cropping. Save a master file at maximum resolution before generating platform-specific sizes to enable future format changes. Check updated dimension requirements quarterly since platforms occasionally adjust recommended image sizes and aspect ratios.","p5":"Yes, all processing uses HTML5 Canvas API running in your browser. Your images are never uploaded to any server. The file stays on your device throughout the resizing process, and you download the result directly from your browser's memory."}
