{"p2":"Upload a PDF and the tool extracts all text content from every page, preserving paragraph breaks but removing formatting like bold, italics, and fonts. The resulting plain text can be copied directly to your clipboard or downloaded as a TXT file for use in word processors, databases, or note-taking applications. This works best with text-based PDFs rather than scanned images, which require OCR processing first. All text extraction happens in your browser, ensuring documents containing confidential information remain private on your device during the conversion process.","p3":"Content writers extract text from PDF research materials to create quote compilations and reference notes for article drafting. Data analysts extract tables and figures from PDF reports to reformat into CSV files for database import. Students copy PDF lecture notes into study guide documents where they can add highlights and annotations. Translators extract source text from PDF documents to paste into translation software for language conversion. Developers extract configuration data or code snippets embedded in PDF technical documentation for copying into development environments.","p4":"Extracted text loses all original formatting including headings, lists, tables, and columns—what you get is a linear text stream requiring reformatting for most uses. For PDFs with complex multi-column layouts, extracted text may appear scrambled since the tool reads left-to-right without understanding column structure. Check that special characters, symbols, and non-English text transferred correctly, as some fonts may not extract properly. If you need to preserve formatting, consider PDF-to-Word conversion instead of plain text extraction. Use this tool when you only care about content, not presentation—it's ideal for feeding text into analysis tools or creating searchable archives."}
