{"p2":"Converting PDFs to images extracts each page as a separate high-resolution JPG or PNG file, useful for sharing specific pages on social media or embedding in presentations. Going the other direction, you can select multiple image files to combine them into a single multi-page PDF with each photo appearing on its own page. Choose output quality and resolution settings to balance file size against image clarity based on your intended use. The bidirectional conversion happens entirely in your browser, so vacation photos, design mockups, or business graphics remain private throughout the transformation process.","p3":"Graphic designers convert finished PDF mockups into PNG images with transparent backgrounds for client presentations and portfolio websites. Social media managers extract infographic pages from multi-page PDF reports to share as individual Instagram posts or Twitter cards. E-commerce sellers combine product photos into PDF catalogs for wholesale buyers to download complete collections. Real estate photographers merge property images into PDF showing packages for listing agents to share with potential buyers. Students convert lecture slide PDFs into individual images to insert specific diagrams into research papers and study guides.","p4":"Use PNG output format when you need transparent backgrounds or sharp text clarity, while JPG works better for photographs where smaller file sizes matter more than perfect quality. When creating PDFs from images, arrange files in the correct order before conversion since reordering afterward requires additional tools. For scanned documents being converted to PDF, ensure consistent image orientation beforehand to avoid mixed portrait and landscape pages. If converting PDFs with complex graphics or gradients to images, choose higher DPI settings to prevent visible pixelation in the output. Consider compression settings carefully when batch converting multiple pages—very high quality can produce unwieldy file sizes."}
