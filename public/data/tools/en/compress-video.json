{"p2":"Load a video file from your device and select a target quality level using the slider, ranging from aggressive compression for small file sizes to minimal compression for near-original quality. The tool re-encodes your video using H.264 codec with MediaRecorder API, balancing visual fidelity against file size. Preview a short sample to evaluate the compression before processing the entire file. The encoder runs entirely in your browser, so large videos may take several minutes depending on your hardware. Download the compressed result when encoding completes.","p3":"Video editors shrink 4K footage to 1080p for faster uploads to YouTube or client review platforms. Mobile users compress phone-recorded clips before texting or emailing them to avoid cellular data limits. Podcasters reduce video file sizes for embedding on websites without slowing page load times. Archivists batch-compress old home videos to save hard drive space while preserving watchable quality. Course creators optimize tutorial videos to fit within learning management system file size caps.","p4":"Test different quality settings on the same 10-second clip to find the sweet spot between size reduction and acceptable visual loss. Avoid compressing already-compressed videos repeatedly, as each generation degrades quality through cumulative artifacts. For talking-head videos, prioritize audio bitrate over video since viewers tolerate lower resolution but not distorted speech. Compress once at the highest acceptable quality, then store the original uncompressed file separately for future edits. Use aggressive compression for temporary share links but keep moderate settings for archival or professional use."}
