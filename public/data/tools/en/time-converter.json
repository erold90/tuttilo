{"p2":"Pick your starting time unit from milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years. Input your time value. Select your target unit. Tuttilo converts instantly, showing precise results for your selected units. The converter handles both extremely short durations like milliseconds for programming applications and extended periods like years for project planning. All time calculations process directly in your browser to keep your data private.","p3":"Software developers convert milliseconds to seconds when analyzing program execution times and performance benchmarks. Project managers translate task durations from hours into days or weeks for Gantt charts and resource planning. Scientists conducting experiments convert timing measurements between units for standardized research reporting. Freelancers track billable time by converting minutes worked into decimal hours for invoicing. Astronomers calculate cosmic event durations spanning years for observational planning.","p4":"When converting between small and large units, beware of rounding errors that compound—use full precision in intermediate calculations. Business time conversions often assume standardized values (1 month = 30 days, 1 year = 365 days) that don't account for actual calendar variations in specific date ranges. For programming applications, Unix timestamps measure seconds since January 1, 1970, requiring specialized conversion handling. Remember that time zones and daylight saving time affect real-world time calculations beyond simple unit conversion—this tool converts durations, not specific moments in time across time zones."}
