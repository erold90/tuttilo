{"p2":"Type or paste text into the input field, then select a voice from your browser's built-in speech synthesis library. Adjust the speed slider to control narration pace, from slow and deliberate to fast-paced. Modify pitch if you want a higher or lower voice tone. Click play to preview the speech output, making adjustments as needed. When satisfied, click generate to process the audio, then download the file as an MP3 or WAV. The synthesis happens entirely in your browser using native Web Speech API.","p3":"Content creators generate voiceovers for YouTube videos or tutorials when recording their own voice isn't practical. Educators create audio versions of written lessons for students with visual impairments or reading difficulties. Authors listen to their drafts read aloud to catch awkward phrasing or pacing issues during editing. Language learners hear correct pronunciation of foreign words or sentences they're studying. Accessibility advocates provide audio alternatives for web content that lacks proper screen reader support.","p4":"Choose natural-sounding voices over robotic ones when available, though quality varies significantly by browser and operating system. Add punctuation like commas and periods to control pacing, since TTS engines use these cues for pauses. Spell out acronyms, numbers, and abbreviations phonetically if the voice mispronounces them. Break long text into shorter paragraphs and generate separately to avoid single enormous audio files. Test different speed and pitch combinations to find the most natural-sounding settings for your specific text and voice."}
