{"p2":"Select the type of dataset you need—users, products, orders, or blog posts—then specify how many records to generate. For user data, the tool creates realistic names, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, and registration dates. Product datasets include names, descriptions, prices, categories, and SKUs. Order data combines user IDs with products, quantities, and timestamps. Blog posts come with titles, content excerpts, authors, and publication dates. All data is generated using random but realistic patterns. Export your dataset as JSON or CSV with a single click for immediate use in your projects.","p3":"Developers populate database seeds for local development environments without exposing real customer data. QA engineers create test datasets for stress-testing pagination, search, and filtering features. Database administrators generate sample records to test query performance and indexing strategies. API developers need realistic mock data to demonstrate endpoints in documentation. Students learning SQL or database design practice queries on substantial datasets without manual entry. Frontend developers test table layouts, list views, and infinite scroll implementations with diverse content.","p4":"Generate larger datasets than you initially think you need—testing with 10 records often misses bugs that appear with 1,000. For realistic testing, combine multiple dataset types (users + orders + products) to simulate relational database structures. When testing pagination, generate enough records to fill at least 5-10 pages. Vary the generation seed or regenerate multiple times to catch edge cases in sorting and filtering logic. For UI testing, pay attention to generated text lengths to ensure your layouts handle both short and long content gracefully.","p5":"The tool uses seedable random generation algorithms to create diverse but consistent data across multiple runs when needed. Email addresses follow proper RFC standards and include various domain patterns. Phone numbers use realistic country code and area code formats for international testing. Generated dates span realistic ranges—user registrations from the past 2 years, order dates within the last 90 days. Product prices follow logarithmic distribution to simulate real market patterns. CSV exports include proper escaping for fields containing commas or quotes."}
