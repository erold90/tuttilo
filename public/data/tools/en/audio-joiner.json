{"p2":"Upload multiple audio files by clicking the add button repeatedly or selecting several files at once. Drag and drop the file cards to reorder them in your desired sequence. The tool plays files in top-to-bottom order, concatenating them seamlessly without gaps or overlaps. Preview the joined result to confirm the arrangement sounds correct. The merger processes everything in your browser using Web Audio API to combine the tracks. Download the final merged audio file in your preferred format.","p3":"Podcast editors merge intro music, main episode content, and outro music into a single publishable file. Musicians combine separate instrument or vocal recordings into a complete song arrangement. Audiobook creators join individual chapter recordings into full-length books for distribution. Language course developers concatenate vocabulary lessons, exercises, and review sections into cohesive units. Sound designers build complex soundscapes by layering ambient tracks, effects, and music cues in sequence.","p4":"Ensure all source files have the same sample rate and bit depth before merging to avoid unexpected pitch or speed changes. Use fade-out on the last file and fade-in on the next to create smooth transitions between disparate audio sources. Arrange files in a logical order before merging, as editing the sequence afterward requires re-uploading and re-merging. For podcasts, place intro and outro music at consistent volume levels to the main content to avoid jarring shifts. Export the joined file in lossless WAV format if you plan to edit it further, converting to MP3 only for final distribution."}
