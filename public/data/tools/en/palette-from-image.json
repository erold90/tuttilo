{"p2":"Upload any image from your device by clicking the upload area or dragging and dropping a file. The tool analyzes pixel data using k-means clustering algorithms to identify the most dominant and representative colors in your image, extracting typically 5-8 key hues that capture the image's color essence. Each extracted color displays with its hex code, and you can click any swatch to copy the value instantly. This makes it effortless to build color schemes inspired by photographs, artwork, or brand imagery. All image processing happens in your browser — files never upload to any server.","p3":"Brand designers extract palettes from product photography to ensure website color schemes harmonize perfectly with hero images and product shots. Interior decorators upload room photos to identify existing colors in furniture and decor, then build complementary schemes for walls and accents. Social media managers create branded graphics by extracting colors from company logos or campaign photography to maintain consistent visual identity across posts. Web developers building themes for photography portfolios extract palettes from featured images to create cohesive layouts where UI colors complement rather than clash with content.","p4":"Images with many colors may extract muddy or overly similar shades — for cleaner palettes, upload images with distinct color regions or limited palettes to begin with. The algorithm weights colors by area, so dominant background colors appear more prominently than small accent details. Crop your image before uploading to focus on specific color regions if you want a palette from just part of the image. Lighting affects extracted colors significantly; an outdoor photo in golden hour yields warmer tones than the same scene in midday light. Combine extracted palettes with the harmony generator to expand beyond literal image colors into complementary schemes."}
