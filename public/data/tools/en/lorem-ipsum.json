{"p2":"Select whether you want paragraphs, sentences, or individual words, then enter the quantity you need. Click generate and the tool produces classical Lorem Ipsum placeholder text derived from Cicero's \"De finibus bonorum et malorum\". The Latin-like gibberish fills space without distracting readers with meaningful content during design phases. Copy the output with one click to paste into mockups, wireframes, or prototypes. Generate repeatedly to get fresh variations. All text generation happens instantly in your browser.","p3":"Web designers fill homepage layouts, blog templates, and landing page mockups with placeholder text before real copy arrives. Graphic designers populate brochure and poster layouts to demonstrate typography and spacing to clients. UI/UX designers test how different text lengths affect responsive layouts across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports. Frontend developers verify CSS styling and font rendering using consistent dummy content before backend integration. Print designers fill magazine spreads and book layouts to present page design concepts without final manuscript text.","p4":"Use paragraph-based generation for body copy, sentence-based for headlines and callouts, and word-based for buttons or labels. Generate slightly more text than needed, then trim to fit rather than stretching short lorem ipsum awkwardly. Replace placeholder text with real copy as soon as possible, since clients sometimes forget lorem ipsum isn't final content. Avoid leaving lorem ipsum in production sites, as search engines penalize pages with nonsense text. For varied layouts, generate different quantities across sections to simulate real content's unpredictable length."}
