{"p2":"Browse curated font pairings organized by style categories like elegant, modern, classic, bold, and minimal. Each suggestion displays a heading in the primary font paired with body text in the complementary font, letting you see exactly how the combination looks together. Click any pairing to view Google Fonts links for both typefaces, ready to add to your project via the standard link tag or CSS import. Adjust the preview text to see how your actual content would appear in each pairing. Filter by style mood to match your project's aesthetic goals, with all recommendations based on proven typographic principles.","p3":"Website designers establishing visual hierarchy pair a distinctive heading font with a readable body font to create interest without sacrificing legibility. Brand identity projects match serif headings with sans-serif body text (or vice versa) to balance traditional and modern aesthetics. Portfolio sites use bold display fonts for project titles paired with neutral body fonts that keep focus on work samples. Marketing materials combine script or decorative headers with clean sans-serifs for body copy to add personality while maintaining professional readability.","p4":"Contrast is key: pair serif with sans-serif, condensed with wide, heavy with light — similar fonts compete rather than complement. Limit projects to 2-3 typefaces maximum; more creates visual chaos and hurts performance with additional font file downloads. When pairing, ensure x-heights (the height of lowercase letters) are similar so body text and headings feel cohesive at different sizes. Google Fonts suggests popular pairings based on actual usage data from millions of websites, making these combinations battle-tested. Always load font-display: swap to prevent invisible text during load, especially on slower connections."}
