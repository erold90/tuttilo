{"p2":"Tuttilo's Markdown editor provides a split-pane interface where you write on the left and see the rendered output on the right. Simply paste or type your Markdown text, and the preview updates instantly. The editor recognizes standard syntax including headers (# through ######), emphasis (**bold**, *italic*), unordered and ordered lists, code blocks with triple backticks, blockquotes with >, and inline links. You can copy the rendered output as HTML or keep it as Markdown for documentation. Everything processes in your browser, keeping your drafts private.","p3":"Technical writers use this tool to draft API documentation and user guides while verifying the formatting looks correct before publishing. Developers create README files for GitHub repositories, previewing how the formatted text will appear to other contributors. Bloggers who publish on Markdown-based platforms like Jekyll or Hugo draft posts and check that images, links, and code snippets render properly. Students write formatted notes for technical subjects, using code blocks for programming examples and lists for organizing concepts.","p4":"When working with code blocks, specify the language after the opening backticks (```python) to hint at syntax highlighting when you publish elsewhere. For complex documents, use multiple header levels to create a clear hierarchy that readers can scan quickly. Test all your links by clicking them in the preview pane before finalizing. If you're drafting long-form content, work in sections and copy each completed section out frequently to avoid losing work if you accidentally navigate away."}
