{"p2":"Paste text into the input area and select encode or decode mode. Encoding converts special characters like angle brackets, ampersands, and quotes into their HTML entity equivalents (&lt;, &amp;, &quot;). You can choose between named entities (more readable) and numeric entities (more universal). Decoding reverses the process, transforming entities back into their original characters. The tool handles extended Unicode characters and provides instant conversion as you type. All processing occurs in your browser using JavaScript string manipulation.","p3":"Web developers encode user-generated content before displaying it in HTML to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Technical writers preparing code examples for blogs encode angle brackets so <div> displays as literal text rather than rendering. SEO specialists decode scraped meta descriptions containing entities to analyze actual character length. Email marketers encode special characters in subject lines to ensure proper display across different email clients that handle raw ampersands or quotes inconsistently.","p4":"Always encode untrusted input before inserting it into HTML context—relying on frameworks is wise, but understanding the underlying mechanism prevents security gaps. Named entities (&eacute;) are more readable in source but not all entities have names; use numeric (&#233;) for comprehensive coverage. When encoding for XML contexts, the required entity set is smaller (only &, <, >, \", '). Decode before performing character counts for validation—&nbsp; counts as one character, not six. Test encoding with non-ASCII characters to verify proper UTF-8 handling."}
