{"p2":"Start by entering your home's purchase price and your down payment amount or percentage. Add the interest rate you've been quoted and select your loan term, typically 15 or 30 years. Include your property tax rate and any HOA fees for a complete monthly payment estimate. Tuttilo instantly calculates your principal and interest payment, adds property taxes and fees, then shows your total monthly housing cost. The tool also displays how much you'll pay in total interest over the loan's lifetime and provides a detailed amortization schedule. Your sensitive financial data never leaves your device.","p3":"First-time homebuyers determine their affordable price range by working backward from a comfortable monthly payment. Real estate agents help clients understand the financial impact of different down payment scenarios during house hunting. Homeowners considering refinancing compare their current mortgage payment against potential new terms to calculate long-term savings. Investors evaluating rental properties estimate cash flow by comparing mortgage payments against expected rental income.","p4":"Aim for a down payment of at least 20% to avoid private mortgage insurance, which typically adds 0.5-1% of the loan amount annually. Even a 0.25% difference in interest rate translates to thousands of dollars over a 30-year mortgage, making rate shopping essential. Consider how property taxes may increase over time, especially in rapidly developing areas where reassessments are common. Use the amortization schedule to plan strategic extra payments toward principal, particularly during the early years when interest comprises the largest portion of each payment."}
