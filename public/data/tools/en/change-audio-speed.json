{"p2":"Upload an audio file and select a playback speed multiplier: 0.5x for half-speed, 1.5x for moderate acceleration, or 2.0x for double-speed. The tool adjusts the audio timing while attempting to preserve pitch using time-stretching algorithms that run in your browser. Preview the result to evaluate how the speed change affects clarity and pitch. Slower speeds extend duration and can reveal details, while faster speeds compress time for quicker consumption. Download the time-adjusted audio when processing completes.","p3":"Podcast listeners speed up episodes to 1.5x or 2x to consume more content in less time while commuting or exercising. Musicians slow down complex passages to 0.5x or 0.75x to learn difficult melodies, solos, or lyrics by ear. Audiobook fans accelerate narration to finish books faster when the narrator's natural pace feels too slow. DJs and producers change tempo of acapellas or instrumentals to match different BPM targets for remixing. Transcriptionists slow audio to 0.75x to improve accuracy when typing spoken words verbatim.","p4":"Speed up spoken content to 1.5x or 2x without losing comprehension, but keep music below 1.25x to prevent artifacts and distortion. Slow down only when analyzing specific moments, as listeners rarely tolerate entire slow-motion audio. Combine speed changes with EQ or noise reduction for better clarity, especially at extreme slow speeds where artifacts emerge. Test the adjusted audio with headphones to catch pitch warping or robotic effects that speakers might mask. Export at the highest quality setting to minimize cumulative degradation if you plan further edits."}
