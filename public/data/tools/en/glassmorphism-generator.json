{"p2":"Adjust the blur slider to control how much background content shows through your glass element — higher values create stronger frosting effects. Set background opacity to determine translucency, color saturation to add tint (making your glass warmer or cooler), and border transparency for the characteristic subtle edge highlight. The preview displays your glass card against a customizable gradient background so you can see exactly how it interacts with content behind it. Copy the complete CSS including backdrop-filter, background, and border properties ready for production use. All rendering happens in your browser.","p3":"Dashboard interfaces use glassmorphic panels to layer information over dynamic backgrounds like video or animated gradients while maintaining readability. Mobile app designers create frosted navigation bars and modals that let underlying content peek through, maintaining context while focusing attention on foreground elements. Landing pages employ glass cards for pricing tables or feature highlights, adding sophisticated depth that feels premium and modern. Music player interfaces use glassmorphism for playback controls overlaying album artwork, creating visual cohesion between UI and content.","p4":"Backdrop-filter blur works best between 10-20px — lower values barely frost while higher values make glass opaque. Always include a semi-transparent background fallback for browsers without backdrop-filter support, particularly older Firefox versions. Glassmorphism looks most striking against vibrant or multicolored backgrounds; subtle backgrounds reduce visual impact. Add a thin bright border (1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.18)) to define edges against busy backgrounds. Performance tip: backdrop-filter is GPU-intensive, so limit use to hero sections or key UI elements rather than applying throughout entire layouts."}
