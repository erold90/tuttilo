{"p2":"Paste your content into the text area and click analyze to see detailed keyword statistics. The tool counts total words, character length, and generates frequency tables for single words, two-word phrases (bigrams), and three-word phrases (trigrams). Each keyword shows its occurrence count and density percentage calculated against total word count. Analysis runs entirely in your browser, keeping your content private. Use the results to identify overused terms, spot keyword stuffing issues, and optimize your content's natural flow.","p3":"SEO writers check their articles to ensure target keywords appear at optimal density without crossing into spam territory. Content marketers analyze competitor articles to understand which terms they emphasize for ranking success. Blog editors review submissions to maintain consistent keyword usage across multiple authors. PPC specialists optimize landing page copy to align with ad campaign keywords while keeping the text readable and persuasive.","p4":"Aim for keyword density between 1-2% for primary keywords—higher percentages risk triggering spam filters. Focus more on semantic relevance and related terms rather than exact-match repetition. Pay attention to bigrams and trigrams since search engines increasingly favor natural phrases over single-word stuffing. Use synonyms and variations of your target keyword to create topical depth without repetitive phrasing. Check your headings separately since they carry more SEO weight than body text and should naturally incorporate key terms.","p5":"Keyword density alone doesn't determine rankings anymore. Modern search algorithms value content quality, user intent, semantic relationships, and natural language patterns. Use density analysis as one diagnostic tool among many for content optimization."}
