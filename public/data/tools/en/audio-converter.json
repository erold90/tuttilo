{"p2":"Upload an audio file in any supported format, then select your desired output format from the dropdown: MP3 for universal compatibility, WAV for lossless quality, OGG for open-source projects, FLAC for archival, or AAC for Apple ecosystems. The tool decodes your source file and re-encodes it in the target format using Web Audio API and media processing libraries that run in your browser. Conversion time depends on file length and chosen format. Download the converted audio when processing finishes.","p3":"Music producers convert FLAC or WAV masters to MP3 for distribution on streaming platforms or client delivery. Podcasters convert recorded WAV files to MP3 to reduce file sizes before uploading to hosting services. Audiophiles convert lossy MP3 files to lossless FLAC for archival storage without future quality degradation. App developers convert background music to AAC or OGG formats for compatibility with mobile and web applications. Audio archivists standardize mixed-format collections into a single consistent format for long-term preservation.","p4":"Convert from lossless to lossy formats freely, but avoid converting between lossy formats like MP3 to AAC, as cumulative compression degrades quality. Use WAV or FLAC for intermediate editing steps, converting to MP3 only for final distribution. Match the sample rate and bit depth to your source file unless you specifically need to downsample. Test the converted file in the target application or device before deleting the original to catch codec incompatibilities. For music, convert to 320 kbps MP3 or 256 kbps AAC for near-transparent quality compared to lossless sources."}
