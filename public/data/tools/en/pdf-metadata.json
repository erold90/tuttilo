{"p2":"Upload a PDF to view embedded metadata including document title, author name, subject description, keyword tags, creation date, modification date, page count, and file size. This information is stored in the PDF header and provides context about document origin, versioning, and content. Metadata viewing is read-only—this tool displays information without modifying the file. All metadata reading happens locally in your browser, so PDFs containing proprietary information remain on your device while you inspect their properties.","p3":"Digital forensics investigators examine PDF metadata to determine when documents were created and modified during litigation discovery. Archivists check creation dates on historical document scans to organize chronological digital collections. Publishers verify author attribution and copyright dates in submitted manuscript PDFs before publication. IT security teams inspect metadata to detect potentially forged documents with suspicious creation dates or missing author information. Researchers track version history by comparing modification dates across multiple PDF drafts during collaborative writing projects.","p4":"Metadata can be incomplete or inaccurate if files were created by converters that don't populate fields properly—absence of metadata doesn't necessarily indicate tampering. Author names often reflect the computer account or PDF software license rather than the actual document creator. Creation and modification dates can be manipulated or reset during file conversion, so don't rely solely on timestamps for authentication. Some PDF generators strip metadata entirely for privacy reasons, resulting in blank or minimal information fields. If you need to edit or remove metadata for privacy before sharing files, use a dedicated metadata removal tool rather than manual editing."}
