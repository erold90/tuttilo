{"p2":"Choose a start date and an end date using the date pickers or by typing dates directly. Tuttilo instantly calculates the duration between them, displaying results in years and months, total months, total weeks, total days, total hours, and total minutes. The calculator automatically handles varying month lengths, leap years, and daylight saving time transitions for accurate results. You can swap the dates or calculate backward from a future date. All date calculations run entirely in your browser to keep your personal timeline information private.","p3":"Project managers calculate workday duration between milestone dates to estimate task completion times and identify scheduling conflicts. Couples track the exact duration of their relationships for anniversary celebrations. Event planners count down days until weddings, conferences, or product launches. Legal professionals calculate statute of limitations periods or contract term durations. Travelers planning trips determine how many days they'll be abroad for visa requirements or travel insurance. Pregnant women track pregnancy progression by calculating weeks between conception dates and due dates.","p4":"When calculating business days rather than calendar days, remember that Tuttilo shows calendar days—you'll need to subtract weekends and holidays separately. For contracts spanning years, always verify whether terms use calendar years or anniversary dates, as \"one year\" can mean different things legally. International date formats (MM/DD/YYYY versus DD/MM/YYYY) cause confusion—double-check which format you're using to avoid calculating the wrong span. Add one day when calculating inclusive ranges where both start and end dates count (like a hotel stay from Monday to Wednesday is three nights, not two)."}
