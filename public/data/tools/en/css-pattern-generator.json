{"p2":"Select your pattern type from six options: stripes (vertical or horizontal), dots, grid, checkerboard, zigzag, or diagonal. Adjust pattern size using the slider to control spacing between repeating elements, then pick your two pattern colors (foreground and background). The preview updates in real-time showing how your pattern tiles across a surface. Fine-tune the pattern density and color contrast until you achieve your desired visual effect. Copy the generated CSS background property with one click — it uses linear-gradient or radial-gradient functions that create pure CSS patterns without image files, keeping your site fast and scalable.","p3":"Landing pages use subtle dot or grid patterns on hero section backgrounds to add texture without overwhelming primary content. Dashboard interfaces employ light checkerboard or stripe patterns in data table rows for improved readability by visually separating rows. Portfolio sites create dynamic diagonal stripe backgrounds for section dividers that add energy and guide the eye down the page. E-commerce product cards use understated background patterns to differentiate categories or sales items while maintaining a cohesive design language.","p4":"Keep background patterns subtle by using low-contrast color pairs (10-15% difference in lightness) to avoid competing with foreground content. Smaller pattern sizes (8-16px) feel more refined while larger sizes (32px+) appear bold and graphic — match to your brand personality. Patterns created with CSS gradients perform better than background images since there's no HTTP request or file to download. Combine patterns with background-blend-mode for sophisticated overlay effects on images. Test patterns at different screen sizes since small repeating elements may create moiré patterns or vibration on high-DPI displays."}
