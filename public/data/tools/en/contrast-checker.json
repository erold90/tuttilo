{"p2":"Select your foreground (text) color and background color using the color pickers or by entering hex codes directly. The tool immediately calculates the WCAG contrast ratio and displays pass/fail results for four different criteria: Level AA normal text (4.5:1), Level AA large text (3:1), Level AAA normal text (7:1), and Level AAA large text (4.5:1). Large text means 18pt and above, or 14pt and above when bold. All calculations use the official WCAG 2.1 formula and run entirely in your browser for instant feedback.","p3":"Web developers ensure their site text meets legal accessibility requirements before launching, avoiding potential lawsuits under ADA or Section 508 regulations. UI designers verify that call-to-action buttons have sufficient contrast against page backgrounds so users with low vision can easily identify interactive elements. Mobile app developers test whether their light mode and dark mode color schemes both pass AA standards for users in different lighting conditions. Government agencies building public-facing websites must meet AAA standards in many jurisdictions, requiring careful color selection validated through contrast checking.","p4":"Always aim for Level AA compliance at minimum — many countries legally require it for government and commercial websites. Level AAA provides better accessibility but can be challenging with brand colors; prioritize it for body text while AA may suffice for decorative elements. Remember that contrast requirements differ for large text (18pt+ regular or 14pt+ bold) versus normal text. Contrast ratios apply to all text-on-background scenarios including text over images, so test overlay combinations carefully. When using light text on colored backgrounds, pure white often works better than off-white since every step away from white reduces contrast."}
