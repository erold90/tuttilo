{"p2":"Enter a HEX color code (like #3498db) in the HEX field, or input RGB/HSL/CMYK values in their respective fields. The tool instantly converts to all other formats and displays a large color preview swatch. You can also click the color swatch to open a visual picker for selecting colors interactively. Each format field includes a copy button for quick clipboard access. The conversions calculate using standard color space formulas. All processing runs locally in your browser.","p3":"Designers working across print and digital mediums convert RGB values from screen designs to CMYK approximations for print vendors. Developers refactor CSS codebases to use HSL instead of HEX for easier programmatic color manipulation in themes. Brand managers verify that color values in style guides match across different representation formats. Frontend engineers convert design tool RGB values to HEX codes required by legacy browser compatibility rules.","p4":"RGB values range 0-255, so if you're converting from percentages (like CSS rgb() with 50%), multiply by 2.55 first. HSL is superior to RGB for generating color schemes because adjusting hue by equal amounts creates harmonious colors, while random RGB adjustments create visual chaos. CMYK conversions are approximations since CMYK is a subtractive print color space and RGB is additive screen-based; always request print proofs for exact color matching. When sharing colors with team members, use HEX for simplicity or HSL if they'll need to generate variations programmatically.","seo":"Convert colors between HEX, RGB, HSL, and CMYK formats instantly.
