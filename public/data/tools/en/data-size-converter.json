{"p2":"Select your starting data size unit, from bits up to petabytes. Enter the value you want to convert. Pick your target unit. Tuttilo converts instantly, supporting both decimal (powers of 1000) and binary (powers of 1024) standards. You'll see results in KB, MB, GB, TB, and PB. The converter handles both storage capacity and data transfer rates. Everything processes locally in your browser, keeping your calculations private without server communication.","p3":"System administrators calculate storage requirements when planning server infrastructure or cloud migrations. Photographers estimate how many high-resolution images fit on memory cards or external drives. Video editors determine hard drive capacity needed for projects based on footage size and codec compression. Software developers optimize application size by converting between units to meet app store size limits. Internet users evaluate broadband plans by converting download speeds from megabits per second to understand actual file transfer times.","p4":"Storage manufacturers typically use decimal (1 TB = 1000 GB) while operating systems use binary (1 TiB = 1024 GiB), which explains why your 1 TB drive shows only 931 GB in Windows. Internet speeds are quoted in bits per second, but downloads display in bytes per second—divide by 8 to convert, so 100 Mbps downloads files at approximately 12.5 MB/s. Compressed files may be quoted in their compressed size, but require much more space when extracted. For cloud storage planning, always factor in redundancy and backup copies, typically requiring 2-3× your raw data size."}
