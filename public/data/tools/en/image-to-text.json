{"p2":"Upload a screenshot, scanned document, or photo containing text and select the appropriate language from the six supported options. Tuttilo's OCR engine runs Tesseract.js locally in your browser, analyzing character shapes and patterns to extract readable text. The process takes a few seconds depending on image size and complexity. Once complete, copy the extracted text to your clipboard or edit it directly in the output box. No image data is sent to external servers during recognition.","p3":"Students digitize handwritten notes or textbook pages to create searchable study documents. Researchers extract data from old paper archives or scientific charts that exist only in scanned form. Translators copy foreign-language text from images into translation software when manual retyping would be time-consuming. Business professionals pull contact details from business cards captured by phone cameras. Developers extract code snippets from programming tutorial screenshots when copy-paste isn't available.","p4":"Use high-contrast images with dark text on light backgrounds for best accuracy, ideally scanned at 300 DPI or higher. Rotate or straighten skewed photos before processing, since tilted text reduces recognition rates significantly. Clean up noise, stains, or shadows in image editing software if the original is poor quality. For handwritten text, printed fonts perform far better than cursive scripts. Break large documents into smaller sections to speed up processing and isolate errors. Double-check numbers, special characters, and technical terms manually, as OCR struggles with unusual glyphs."}
