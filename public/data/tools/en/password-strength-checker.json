{"p2":"Type a password into the input field and the tool analyzes it in real time, displaying a strength score from weak to very strong. The entropy calculation measures the theoretical randomness based on character set size and length. Pattern detection identifies common weaknesses like sequential characters (123, abc), repeated characters (aaa), keyboard patterns (qwerty), and common dictionary words. The tool checks against a list of frequently used passwords and provides specific feedback on how to improve strength. All analysis runs locally in your browser using JavaScript pattern matching and entropy formulas.","p3":"Users choosing new passwords get immediate feedback on whether their candidate meets security best practices before creating an account. Security awareness trainers demonstrate to employees why simple passwords like 'password123' are dangerous by showing the instant failure feedback. Developers building registration forms test password validation rules against various inputs to ensure they reject weak passwords. IT departments establish password policies based on entropy thresholds that this tool helps visualize and explain to users.","p4":"Don't rely solely on entropy; a random 8-character password has decent entropy but is still vulnerable to brute force. Check for dictionary words even in strong passwords since attackers use wordlists as a first attack step. Keyboard patterns like 'asdfgh' have high character diversity but low actual randomness. Passphrase strategies using four or more random words create stronger passwords than complex but short ones like 'P@ssw0rd!'. Remember that this tool evaluates strength based on guessing resistance, but you should still use unique passwords per service and enable two-factor authentication."}
