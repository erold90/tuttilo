{"p2":"Enter keywords or phrases to search throughout your PDF, then the tool highlights all matches for review before permanently blacking them out. You can redact sensitive information like social security numbers, names, account numbers, or confidential data by converting text into solid black rectangles. The redaction is permanent—text under black boxes is completely removed from the file rather than simply covered. All redaction happens locally in your browser using client-side processing, ensuring documents containing sensitive personal or business information never upload to external servers.","p3":"Legal teams redact confidential settlement amounts and trade secrets from court filings before submitting to public dockets. HR departments redact employee social security numbers and salary information from internal documents before sharing with external auditors. Healthcare providers redact patient names and medical record numbers from case studies before publishing for educational purposes. Government agencies redact classified information and personally identifiable details from Freedom of Information Act request responses. Financial institutions redact account numbers and personal details from transaction records before sharing with compliance investigators.","p4":"Always review search results carefully before applying redactions, as keyword matching may catch false positives that shouldn't be redacted. Redact more context than strictly necessary if removing isolated words might leave enough clues to deduce sensitive information from surrounding text. Test redacted PDFs by attempting to select or search under black boxes to verify text was truly removed rather than just covered. For systematic redaction of consistent patterns like social security numbers, use regex-style searches if available rather than redacting individual occurrences manually. Keep an unredacted master copy in secure storage before distributing redacted versions, as the redaction process is irreversible once the file is saved."}
