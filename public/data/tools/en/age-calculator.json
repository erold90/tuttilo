{"p2":"Select your birth date using the date picker or type it in directly. Tuttilo calculates your exact age from birth until today, displaying the result in multiple formats: years and months, total months, total weeks, total days, and total hours. You can also calculate age as of a specific future or past date by changing the \"calculate age as of\" field. The tool accounts for leap years and varying month lengths for precise calculations. Your personal date information is processed entirely in your browser without being stored or transmitted.","p3":"Parents track their infant's age in weeks and months for pediatric appointments that require precise developmental tracking. HR departments verify age eligibility for employment programs or retirement benefits. Event planners calculate exact ages for milestone birthday parties like \"10,000 days old\" celebrations. Legal professionals determine age on specific dates for contracts, insurance policies, or eligibility requirements that have strict age thresholds. Genealogy researchers calculate ancestors' ages at significant historical events.","p4":"For baby age tracking, pediatricians typically measure in weeks until 12 weeks, then switch to months until age 2, so toggle between units accordingly. Age calculations matter for legal purposes—someone born on February 29 in a leap year legally ages one year on either February 28 or March 1 in non-leap years depending on jurisdiction. When calculating someone's age at death for obituaries or genealogy, be careful to use their exact birth date and death date to avoid off-by-one errors. In many cultures, age is counted differently (like Korean age), but this calculator uses the international standard where you turn a year older on your birthday."}
