{"p2":"Add each assignment, test, or subject by entering its score and weight (how much it counts toward your final grade). For example, enter \"85\" for a score and \"30\" if that assignment is worth 30% of your total grade. Tuttilo calculates your weighted average instantly, showing your percentage score, letter grade, and GPA on a 4.0 scale. You can add unlimited items and adjust weights and scores to see how different scenarios affect your final grade. All calculations happen locally in your browser to keep your academic performance data private.","p3":"College students track their course grades throughout the semester by entering scores as they receive them and projecting final grades. High school students calculate what score they need on a final exam to achieve a desired course grade. Teachers set up grading rubrics by experimenting with different weight distributions to understand how they affect overall grades. Parents help children understand how individual assignment scores contribute to report card grades. Graduate students track cumulative GPA across multiple courses and semesters.","p4":"Front-load your effort on high-weight assignments and exams, as a 95% on an item worth 40% of your grade impacts your final score far more than perfect scores on items worth 5% each. Always clarify your instructor's grading scale—some use a 10-point scale (90-100 = A) while others use a 7-point scale (93-100 = A). If you're close to a grade boundary, sometimes asking for small extra credit opportunities or assignment resubmissions can push you over the threshold. Track your grade weekly rather than waiting until the end of the term, giving you time to adjust your effort allocation or seek help before it's too late."}
