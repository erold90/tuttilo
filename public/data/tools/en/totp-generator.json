{"p2":"Enter your TOTP secret key (usually provided as a Base32-encoded string when you set up two-factor authentication) and click Generate. The tool computes the current 6-digit time-based one-time password using the TOTP algorithm with HMAC-SHA1 and 30-second time steps. A countdown timer shows how many seconds remain before the code expires and a new one generates. The generated codes match those from authenticator apps like Google Authenticator or Authy when using the same secret key. All computation runs locally in your browser using the Web Crypto API.","p3":"Developers testing TOTP authentication systems generate codes manually to verify their server-side validation logic works correctly. Users who lost access to their authenticator app but saved their secret keys use this to generate codes and regain account access. Security engineers audit TOTP implementations by generating expected codes and comparing them to what the system accepts. Backend developers troubleshoot time synchronization issues by generating codes at specific timestamps to test drift tolerance.","p4":"TOTP codes are only valid for a narrow time window (typically 30 seconds), so ensure your system clock is accurate or codes won't validate. Secret keys are case-insensitive but must not contain spaces or dashes; remove formatting if you copied from a source that includes separators. Save your secret key somewhere secure; if you lose it and your authenticator app, you'll need account recovery. Most systems accept codes from the current and previous time window to account for clock drift and user typing speed. This tool is compatible with RFC 6238 TOTP standard, so codes work with any compliant service.","seo":"TOTP Generator creates time-based one-time passwords using the TOTP algorithm (RFC 6238) with HMAC-SHA1, compatible with all standard authenticator apps."}
