{"p2":"Enter your power value in any unit including Watts, kilowatts, megawatts, horsepower (mechanical), PS (metric horsepower), BTU per hour, or foot-pounds per second. The tool displays instant conversions across all units, letting you compare electrical power in watts against mechanical power in horsepower or thermal power in BTU/h. This makes it simple to translate specifications from different industries or regions that prefer different units. All calculations run locally in your browser for fast, private conversions without server uploads.","p3":"Automotive engineers convert engine power ratings between horsepower and kilowatts when comparing American and European vehicle specifications or meeting regulatory labeling requirements. HVAC contractors translate air conditioner cooling capacity from BTU/h to kilowatts when calculating electrical load for building power systems. Industrial equipment buyers compare motor specifications listed in different units — converting PS to HP or kW depending on manufacturer origin. Solar installers calculate whether a home's peak consumption in kilowatts can be met by available roof space for panel installation.","p4":"Note that mechanical horsepower (745.7W) differs slightly from metric horsepower or PS (735.5W) — always specify which type you're using in technical documentation. BTU per hour measures thermal power, but one BTU/h equals only about 0.293 watts, making it much smaller than you might expect. When sizing generators or electrical circuits, remember to account for power factor — apparent power in VA differs from real power in watts. For continuous loads like motors or heaters, circuit breakers should be rated for at least 125% of the load's power draw to prevent nuisance tripping."}
