{"p2":"Select your starting speed unit, such as kilometers per hour, miles per hour, meters per second, knots, or Mach. Enter your speed value. Choose the unit you want to convert to. Tuttilo instantly converts your speed using standard conversion factors, accounting for the differences between velocity and pace units. The tool supports everything from walking speeds to supersonic velocities. All calculations run in your browser locally, protecting your data privacy.","p3":"Pilots convert indicated airspeeds between knots and miles per hour for flight planning and communication with controllers. Runners interpret treadmill speeds displayed in miles per hour into their preferred minutes-per-kilometer pace. Scientists analyzing motion in physics experiments convert between meters per second and other units for standardized reporting. Travelers driving internationally convert speedometer readings when rental cars display units different from road signs. Maritime navigators calculate vessel speeds in knots while coordinating with land-based teams using mph or km/h.","p4":"Knots (nautical miles per hour) remain standard in aviation and maritime applications because nautical miles directly relate to Earth's geometry (1 nautical mile ≈ 1 minute of latitude). Mach number represents speed relative to the speed of sound, which varies with air temperature and pressure—Mach 1 at sea level is roughly 767 mph, but slower at higher altitudes. For running pace conversions, remember that faster speeds mean smaller pace numbers, which can be counterintuitive. When converting car speeds, note that 100 km/h equals approximately 62 mph, a useful reference for quick mental approximations on international roads."}
