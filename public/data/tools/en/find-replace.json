{"p2":"Paste your text into the main editor, then enter the search term in the 'Find' field. The tool immediately highlights all matches and displays the count. Type your replacement text in the 'Replace' field and choose to replace one match at a time or all matches simultaneously. Toggle case sensitivity for exact matching or enable regular expressions for pattern-based replacements. The preview updates instantly, showing exactly what will change. All text processing happens locally in your browser, so sensitive content never gets transmitted.","p3":"Developers refactoring code use this to rename variables or update API endpoints across large blocks of code without opening an IDE. Content editors update product names, URLs, or terminology across blog posts and marketing copy. Data cleaners remove or normalize inconsistent formatting in CSV exports or log files by finding irregular patterns. Writers working on manuscripts search for overused phrases or filler words to improve their prose by replacing them with varied alternatives.","p4":"When using regular expressions, test your pattern with a small sample first since complex regex can produce unexpected results. To match whole words only, wrap your search term in word boundaries like \\bword\\b to avoid partial replacements inside longer words. Before clicking 'Replace All', scroll through the highlighted matches to verify you're catching what you expect and not accidentally changing unrelated text. Escape special regex characters like dots or parentheses with backslashes if you're searching for literal symbols rather than pattern operators.","seo":"Free online find and replace tool.
