{"p2":"Input your page title, description, and main image URL to generate complete Open Graph meta tags. The tool creates tags for type classification (website, article, product), site name, and locale settings. Tuttilo processes everything client-side, so your content details never leave your device. The generated markup follows Facebook's Open Graph protocol specification exactly. Copy the resulting meta tags and insert them in your HTML head section to control how links appear when shared across social networks.","p3":"Content creators sharing articles on Facebook need proper previews to drive engagement and clicks. E-commerce businesses ensure product images and descriptions display correctly when customers share items with friends. News websites control how headlines and featured images appear in social feeds to maintain brand consistency. Portfolio sites showcasing work need compelling previews that encourage potential clients to click through and explore further.","p4":"Use absolute URLs for all image sources—relative paths won't work when social platforms crawl your page. Your og:image should be at minimum 600x315 pixels, but 1200x630 is optimal for high-resolution displays. Include og:type that accurately reflects your content, whether it's an article, website, or product. After implementation, clear Facebook's cache by pasting your URL into their Sharing Debugger to see the updated preview immediately rather than waiting for automatic refresh.","p5":"Absolutely. Open Graph tags are recognized by Facebook, LinkedIn, Discord, Slack, Pinterest, and many other platforms. Twitter also reads OG tags as fallback when Twitter Card tags aren't present."}
