{"p2":"Paste line-based text into the input area and click Remove Duplicates. The tool scans all lines, keeps the first occurrence of each unique line, and removes all subsequent duplicates. Case sensitivity is optional—disable it to treat \"hello\" and \"Hello\" as duplicates. The trim whitespace option removes leading/trailing spaces before comparison, so \" hello\" and \"hello \" are considered identical. Empty lines can be preserved or removed. Results show how many duplicates were eliminated. Processing is instant and entirely local.","p3":"Data analysts clean CSV files by removing duplicate rows before importing into databases. Developers deduplicate lists of URLs, email addresses, or IDs collected from multiple sources. SEO specialists clean keyword lists by removing repetitions before importing to tools. System administrators merge log files and remove duplicate entries to reduce file size and noise.","p4":"Always preserve the original file before deduplication—if line order matters semantically, duplicate removal may break logic. Enable case-insensitive mode when working with user-submitted data (emails, names) where inconsistent capitalization is common. Whitespace trimming is essential for real-world data—users often add accidental spaces that create false uniques. Empty line preservation depends on context: keep them in formatted text, remove them in data lists. Verify the first vs. last occurrence behavior—some tools keep the last, which matters for timestamped data."}
