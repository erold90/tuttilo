{"p2":"Input your initial investment amount and the final value after selling or at the current market price. Specify how long you held the investment in years and months. The calculator immediately computes your net profit or loss, your ROI as a percentage, and your annualized ROI to compare investments with different holding periods. You can also see how your return compares to common benchmarks. Because Tuttilo processes everything client-side, your investment performance data remains completely confidential without any third-party access.","p3":"Stock investors evaluate whether to hold or sell positions by calculating actual returns including dividends. Real estate investors assess the profitability of rental properties by inputting purchase price, renovation costs, and sale price. Business owners determine which marketing campaigns delivered the best return by comparing cost against revenue generated. Cryptocurrency traders track portfolio performance across multiple assets with different entry and exit points.","p4":"Always annualize your returns when comparing investments held for different time periods, as a 20% return over five years is vastly different from 20% in one year. Factor in all costs including transaction fees, taxes, and opportunity costs for accurate ROI calculations. Be cautious when comparing ROI across different asset classes, as higher returns typically come with proportionally higher risk. Track your ROI against relevant benchmarks like the S&P 500 index to understand whether you're truly beating the market after accounting for the time value of money."}
