{"p2":"Adjust the length slider to set how many characters your password should contain, with longer passwords providing exponentially more security. Select character set checkboxes to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols in the generated password. Click Generate to create a cryptographically random password using the browser's Web Crypto API, which provides true randomness rather than predictable pseudo-random patterns. The strength meter evaluates your password in real time based on length and character diversity. Copy the generated password with one click.","p3":"Users setting up new online accounts generate strong passwords that meet site requirements for length and character types. IT administrators create temporary passwords for new employee accounts that are random enough to resist guessing attacks. Developers generating API keys or secret tokens use this to create random strings for authentication systems. Security-conscious individuals rotating passwords quarterly generate new unique passwords for each service to avoid reusing credentials.","p4":"Aim for at least 16 characters for critical accounts like email or banking, even if the site allows shorter passwords. Enable all character types unless the service explicitly prohibits symbols, which unfortunately some legacy systems do. Store generated passwords in a password manager immediately rather than writing them down or relying on memory. If you're generating passwords for multiple accounts, create a different one for each service; using the same password across sites means one breach compromises all accounts. For maximum security, combine a generated password with two-factor authentication.","seo":"Generate cryptographically secure passwords with customizable length and character sets.
