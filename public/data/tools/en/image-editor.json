{"p2":"Upload an image to access crop, resize, rotate, flip, brightness/contrast/saturation adjustments, and compression controls all in a unified interface. Make multiple edits in sequence without downloading and reuploading between operations—adjust brightness, then crop, then resize in one continuous workflow. The visual preview updates in real-time as you modify settings, letting you fine-tune adjustments before applying final changes. All editing happens locally in your browser using Canvas API, so personal photos, business graphics, or proprietary design files remain private on your device throughout the editing process.","p3":"Social media managers crop product photos to square aspect ratios for Instagram while adjusting brightness for optimal mobile display. Real estate agents rotate sideways property photos and enhance contrast to make room details more visible in listings. Bloggers resize header images to exact pixel dimensions required by website templates while compressing file size for faster loading. E-commerce sellers adjust saturation and lighting on product shots to ensure accurate color representation. Event photographers batch-edit brightness and crop ratios on hundreds of event photos before client delivery.","p4":"Make destructive edits like cropping and rotation first before adjusting colors, since those operations change the pixel data that color adjustments will affect. When resizing, maintain aspect ratio unless you specifically need a different shape—arbitrary resizing can distort subjects. Use incremental adjustments for brightness and saturation rather than extreme shifts, as over-processing creates unnatural appearance and posterization artifacts. Compress as the final step after all other edits are complete to avoid repeatedly compressing the same data and accumulating quality loss. Save originals separately before editing important images, since edits are permanent once you download the result."}
