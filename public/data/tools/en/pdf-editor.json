{"p2":"Load your PDF and click anywhere on the page to insert new text with automatic font and size matching to blend seamlessly with existing content. The tool detects fonts already used in the document and attempts to replicate them, though complex or proprietary fonts fall back to standard alternatives. Beyond text editing, you can draw freehand annotations, highlight passages, and add shapes or arrows for visual markup. All editing operations modify a copy of your document locally in the browser, leaving the original file unchanged on your device until you explicitly download the edited version.","p3":"Property managers fill in tenant information on standardized lease agreement templates without printing and rescanning. Educators annotate student essay PDFs with margin comments and correction marks before returning graded assignments. Construction supervisors markup architectural plans with revision notes and measurement corrections for contractor teams. Medical office staff add patient appointment details and insurance codes to blank intake form templates. Event planners edit venue contract PDFs to insert specific dates, attendee counts, and customized catering requirements before submitting to suppliers.","p4":"For best font matching, stick to common typefaces like Arial, Helvetica, or Times New Roman that are universally available across systems. When adding substantial new text, check that line spacing and alignment match surrounding content to avoid obvious visual inconsistencies. Use the drawing tools sparingly on text-heavy documents to prevent obscuring important information—lighter colors and thinner lines work better for annotations. If font matching fails, consider replacing entire text blocks rather than mixing mismatched fonts within paragraphs. Always preview the final page before downloading to catch alignment issues or text overflow that may not be obvious during editing."}
