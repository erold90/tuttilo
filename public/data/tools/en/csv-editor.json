{"p2":"Paste CSV data into the input field and click Parse to load it into the spreadsheet grid. Click any cell to edit its value directly—changes are reflected instantly. Use the Add Row and Add Column buttons to expand your dataset, or Remove Last Row/Column to trim it. Toggle between comma, semicolon, and tab delimiters to match your target format. When finished, click Copy to copy the edited CSV to your clipboard. The tool handles quoted fields and escaped characters automatically. All editing happens in your browser memory.","p3":"Data entry clerks quickly fix typos or missing values in CSV exports before importing them into databases. Spreadsheet users adjust delimiter types when opening files in applications that expect specific separators. Developers prototype small datasets by pasting template CSVs and filling in test values without launching Excel. Database administrators add or remove columns from sample data files to match schema changes before bulk imports.","p4":"Always check for embedded commas in fields—they require quoting in the output CSV or they'll create extra columns. Use the delimiter switcher when working with European systems that default to semicolons (because commas serve as decimal separators). After adding rows, scroll down to verify the grid didn't insert them in the wrong position. Remove trailing empty columns before exporting to avoid creating unnecessary fields in the target system. Test with edge cases like newlines within quoted fields to ensure proper escaping."}
