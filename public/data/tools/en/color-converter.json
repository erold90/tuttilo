{"p2":"Choose a color using the visual picker or paste a HEX, RGB, HSL, HWB, or CMYK value into any input field. The tool instantly calculates and displays equivalent values in all supported formats. HEX values can include 3-digit shorthand (#fff) or 6-digit full notation (#ffffff). RGB supports both comma-separated (255, 0, 0) and functional (rgb(255, 0, 0)) syntax. HSL, HWB, and CMYK formats are similarly flexible. Alpha transparency is preserved across conversions where supported. All color math runs locally in your browser.","p3":"Designers converting brand colors from print (CMYK) to web (HEX/RGB) for consistent cross-medium branding. Frontend developers translating design mockup colors into CSS values for implementation. Developers debugging color inconsistencies verify that designer-provided colors match what's rendered. Accessibility specialists convert colors to HSL to adjust lightness values for WCAG contrast ratio compliance.","p4":"CMYK values don't map perfectly to RGB—expect slight hue shifts when converting print colors to screen. Use HSL when you need to create color variations (lighter, darker, more saturated) by adjusting single parameters. HWB (Hue-Whiteness-Blackness) is underutilized but excellent for generating tints and shades programmatically. Alpha transparency (rgba, hsla) isn't supported in HEX format without 8-digit notation (#rrggbbaa), which isn't universally supported. Always verify converted colors visually; mathematical equivalence doesn't guarantee perceptual matching across devices."}
