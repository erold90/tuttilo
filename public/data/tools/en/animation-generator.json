{"p2":"Select one of eight preset animation effects: bounce, fade-in, slide-in (from top/right/bottom/left), rotate, pulse, shake, zoom-in, or flip. Set your animation duration in seconds, choose a timing function (linear, ease, ease-in, ease-out, or ease-in-out) that controls acceleration, and specify iteration count (once, twice, or infinite loop). The preview box demonstrates your animation continuously so you can fine-tune timing and feel before committing. Copy both the CSS class and @keyframes rule together — paste both into your stylesheet and apply the class to any element.","p3":"Marketing landing pages use fade-in animations on hero text and call-to-action buttons to grab attention as users scroll into view. E-commerce product pages employ subtle zoom-in effects on images during hover states to invite interaction without being jarring. Loading screens use infinite pulse or rotate animations to indicate processing without requiring actual progress data. Onboarding flows slide-in tutorial cards sequentially to guide new users through features without overwhelming them all at once.","p4":"Match timing functions to animation intent: ease-out for elements entering the viewport (fast start, slow finish feels natural), ease-in for elements exiting (accelerate away), and ease-in-out for looping animations. Keep durations short (0.3-0.6s) for UI feedback, longer (0.8-1.2s) for decorative effects — anything over 2s feels sluggish. Infinite iterations work for loading indicators but exhaust users on content elements; use sparingly. Combine animation-delay with animation-fill-mode: forwards to create staggered sequences where elements animate one after another. Test on low-end devices since complex keyframe animations can cause jank on slower GPUs."}
