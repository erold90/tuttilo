{"p2":"Set the desired string length using the slider or number input. Toggle character set options: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Choose how many random strings to generate in one batch. Click Generate and cryptographically secure random strings appear instantly. Each string is independent and unpredictable. Copy individual strings or copy all at once. For maximum security, the tool uses crypto.getRandomValues() rather than Math.random(). All generation happens in your browser without server requests.","p3":"Developers generate secure API keys, tokens, or session identifiers for authentication systems. System administrators create temporary passwords for new user accounts that require manual password change on first login. QA engineers generate random test data for stress testing input validation. Database designers create sample unique identifiers when prototyping schema with synthetic data.","p4":"Cryptographic randomness matters—never use Math.random() for security-sensitive strings. Length is more important than character set complexity; a 20-character alphanumeric string is stronger than a 10-character string with symbols. Avoid ambiguous characters (0/O, 1/l/I) in user-facing strings to reduce support burden. Store generated secrets securely; regenerating identical strings is statistically impossible. For passwords, prioritize length over complexity—four random words beat a complex 8-character string. Use base64 encoding for API tokens to ensure URL-safe characters."}
