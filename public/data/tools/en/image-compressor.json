{"p2":"Upload single or multiple images and adjust quality sliders to control compression level for each format type. The tool shows before/after file sizes in real-time, helping you balance size reduction against visual quality. Batch mode processes dozens of images simultaneously with consistent compression settings, eliminating repetitive manual adjustments. All compression happens in your browser using client-side algorithms, ensuring personal photos, business graphics, or proprietary product images never upload to external servers during size reduction.","p3":"Web developers compress hero images and graphics to improve page load speed and SEO performance without redesigning layouts. E-commerce sellers batch-compress hundreds of product photos to meet marketplace file size limits while maintaining visual appeal. Bloggers compress featured images to reduce hosting storage costs and bandwidth usage. Email marketers compress newsletter graphics to ensure fast loading in email clients with aggressive image blocking. Real estate agents compress property photos to fit more images within MLS listing size restrictions.","p4":"Start with 80-85% quality for JPG compression—most viewers can't distinguish it from the original, but file sizes drop by 40-60%. PNG compression is lossless, meaning quality sliders affect file size but not visual appearance; for dramatic PNG size reduction, consider converting to JPG if transparency isn't needed. Compress copies rather than originals to preserve high-quality masters for future use cases requiring maximum resolution. Before batch-compressing hundreds of images, test settings on a few representative samples to ensure results meet your quality standards. If compressed images will be further edited or processed, use minimal compression initially to preserve quality headroom for subsequent operations."}
