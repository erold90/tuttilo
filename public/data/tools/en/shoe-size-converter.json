{"p2":"Select your starting shoe size system: US Men's, US Women's, UK, European (EU), or centimeters (actual foot length). Enter your shoe size. Pick the sizing system you want to convert to. Tuttilo displays the equivalent size immediately, using standard conversion charts employed by footwear manufacturers. Remember that these conversions are approximations—brands vary slightly in their sizing. The tool processes everything locally in your browser to keep your personal measurements private.","p3":"Online shoppers purchasing shoes from international retailers convert sizes to ensure proper fit before ordering. Travelers buying shoes abroad quickly determine their size in unfamiliar sizing systems. Gift buyers measure recipients' feet in centimeters to order shoes when they don't know the person's stated shoe size. Retailers stocking international brands convert between systems for shelf labeling and inventory management. Athletes ordering specialty sports shoes from manufacturers in different countries verify sizing compatibility.","p4":"US Women's sizes are typically 1.5 sizes larger than US Men's sizes for the same foot length—so a Women's 8 equals a Men's 6.5. UK sizes run about one size smaller than US sizes due to different starting points in their sizing scales. European sizes are based on the Paris point (2/3 cm), making them more precise but less intuitive. Always measure both feet and use the larger measurement, as most people have slightly different sized feet. Shoe size converters show the nearest equivalent, but width (narrow, medium, wide) isn't standardized across systems—order from retailers with flexible return policies when buying international brands."}
