{"p2":"Enter your website's URLs one per line or paste an entire list of pages you want indexed. Set the change frequency (daily, weekly, monthly) and priority values for each URL to guide search engine crawlers. The tool generates valid XML sitemap format that complies with sitemaps.org protocol standards. Processing happens locally in your browser for complete privacy. Download the generated sitemap.xml file and upload it to your website's root directory, then submit the URL to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools.","p3":"New website launches benefit from sitemaps that help search engines discover all pages immediately rather than waiting for natural crawling. Large e-commerce sites with thousands of product pages ensure nothing gets missed during indexing. Blog platforms with deep archives make older content accessible to search bots that might not crawl past recent posts. Multi-language sites submit separate sitemaps for each language version to improve international SEO performance.","p4":"Split large sites into multiple sitemap files if you exceed 50,000 URLs or 50MB uncompressed size limits. Use a sitemap index file to reference multiple sitemaps on big sites. Set higher priority values (0.8-1.0) for your most important pages like homepage and key landing pages, while giving lower priority (0.3-0.5) to tags and archives. Update your sitemap whenever you add significant new content and resubmit to search consoles. Include only canonical URLs to avoid confusing search engines with duplicate content across URL variations.","p5":"Google, Bing, Yahoo, Yandex, and virtually all modern search engines support XML sitemaps. Some engines also support sitemap index files, image sitemaps, and video sitemaps for specialized content."}
