{"p2":"This unified tool handles three core PDF operations without switching between separate utilities. Drop multiple PDFs to merge them into a single document, maintaining the original page order or rearranging files as needed. Use the split function to extract specific page ranges from lengthy reports or break multi-chapter documents into individual files. The rotation feature lets you correct pages that were scanned upside down or in landscape orientation. All operations process locally in your browser, so confidential business documents or personal records remain on your device throughout the entire workflow.","p3":"Administrative assistants merge individual invoices, receipts, and shipping documents into comprehensive monthly financial packages for accounting departments. Teachers combine student assignments, rubrics, and feedback sheets into single graded submission files. Project managers split large specification documents into separate sections for different contractor teams. Researchers rotate scanned journal articles and book chapters to proper orientation before adding them to reference libraries. HR departments merge offer letters, benefit summaries, and policy handbooks into complete new-hire onboarding packets.","p4":"When merging files, arrange them in the correct sequence before processing to avoid having to repeat the operation. For large documents, split by logical chapter breaks or content sections rather than arbitrary page counts to maintain coherent file organization. Double-check page rotation results, especially for mixed-orientation documents where some pages are deliberately landscape. If you're extracting specific pages repeatedly, note the page numbers beforehand to streamline future split operations. Keep originals until you verify merged or split files are complete and properly formatted."}
