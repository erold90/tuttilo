{"p2":"Paste JavaScript code into the input panel and click Minify to compress it. The minifier removes all comments (both single-line // and multi-line /* */), strips unnecessary whitespace, and condenses the code to its minimal functional form. Newlines are eliminated except where required by syntax, and indentation is removed entirely. Variable names and function names are preserved (no obfuscation occurs). The output is ready for production deployment. Minification happens entirely in your browser using JavaScript AST parsing.","p3":"Frontend developers minify scripts before deploying to reduce bandwidth and improve page load times. Web performance engineers combine multiple JavaScript files and minify the result to minimize HTTP requests. Browser extension authors reduce extension size to meet browser store file limits. CDN users prepare optimized versions of libraries for edge caching where every kilobyte counts toward bandwidth costs.","p4":"Always keep the original source files—minified code is nearly impossible to debug. Minification isn't obfuscation; function and variable names remain readable, so don't rely on it for security. Test minified code thoroughly; although rare, aggressive whitespace removal can break code that relies on automatic semicolon insertion. Combine minification with gzip compression for maximum size reduction—minified code compresses better. Use source maps if you need to debug production issues; map the minified code back to original sources."}
