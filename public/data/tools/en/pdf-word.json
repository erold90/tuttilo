{"p2":"Drag a PDF file to convert it into an editable DOCX document, preserving text formatting, tables, and basic layout structure. The tool analyzes PDF content and reconstructs it as native Word elements rather than embedded images, allowing you to modify text, adjust formatting, and reflow content. Converting in the opposite direction creates PDFs from Word files while maintaining fonts, styles, and page structure. The bidirectional conversion runs entirely within your browser using client-side processing libraries, ensuring documents containing proprietary information or confidential data never leave your computer.","p3":"Freelance writers convert client-provided PDF briefs into Word documents to add tracked changes and editorial comments during the revision process. HR managers transform PDF job descriptions into editable templates for creating new position postings with updated requirements. Consultants convert proposal PDFs received from partners into Word format to merge sections and customize content for specific clients. Academic administrators turn PDF course syllabi into editable Word files for faculty to update semester schedules and reading lists. Small business owners convert vendor contracts from PDF to Word to mark up terms before sending to legal review.","p4":"PDF-to-Word conversion works best with text-based documents rather than scanned images, which require OCR processing separately. Complex layouts with multiple columns, text boxes, or intricate graphics may require manual formatting adjustments after conversion. Before converting important documents, check that all special characters and symbols transferred correctly, particularly mathematical notation or foreign language text. When creating PDFs from Word, use high-quality settings if the document contains detailed charts or diagrams. Save converted files under new names to preserve the original in case you need to reference the source formatting."}
