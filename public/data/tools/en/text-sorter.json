{"p2":"Paste lines of text into the input area and choose a sort method: alphabetical (A-Z), reverse alphabetical (Z-A), by line length (shortest first), numeric (interprets lines as numbers), or random (shuffle). Click Sort and the rearranged text appears instantly. Alphabetical sort is case-insensitive by default but can be made case-sensitive. Numeric sort treats lines as numbers, sorting 10 after 2 (unlike alphabetical, which sorts 10 before 2). Random sort shuffles lines unpredictably. All sorting happens client-side in your browser.","p3":"Developers organize import statements alphabetically for cleaner code. Writers arrange list items by length to create visually balanced layouts. Database administrators sort column names alphabetically when documenting schemas. Teachers randomize student name lists for selecting volunteers or forming groups. Data analysts sort numeric IDs to identify gaps or duplicates in sequences.","p4":"Numeric sort only works when each line is purely numeric—mixed alphanumeric lines will produce unexpected results. Use case-sensitive alphabetical sorting when working with programming identifiers where case distinguishes meaning. Random sort is useful for creating unbiased sample datasets, but it's not cryptographically secure. Length-based sorting creates aesthetic effects in design; shortest-to-longest flows well visually. Always preview sorted output before using it—sorting can break semantic relationships between lines (like paired data)."}
