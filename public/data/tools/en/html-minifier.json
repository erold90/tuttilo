{"p2":"Paste HTML markup into the input area and click Minify. The tool removes HTML comments (except conditional comments for IE), collapses multiple spaces between tags into single spaces, strips leading/trailing whitespace in text nodes, and removes optional closing tags where valid. Attributes are preserved exactly as written. The minifier handles inline CSS and JavaScript by leaving them functionally intact while removing surrounding HTML whitespace. Output is clean, single-line HTML ready for production. All minification occurs client-side in your browser.","p3":"Email marketers minify HTML email templates to reduce file size and improve deliverability through spam filters that penalize large emails. Landing page designers optimize above-the-fold HTML to reduce initial render time. Developers embedding HTML snippets in JSON or JavaScript strings minify to avoid multi-line escaping issues. Static site generators produce minified HTML during build processes to maximize page speed scores.","p4":"Whitespace between inline elements affects layout—collapsing it may cause rendering differences, so test thoroughly. Don't minify HTML during development; readable markup is essential for debugging. Comments containing licensing information should be preserved—some minifiers support custom comment preservation. Minification combined with gzip offers diminishing returns; gzip handles repetitive HTML patterns efficiently. Always validate minified output with an HTML validator to ensure structural integrity wasn't compromised."}
