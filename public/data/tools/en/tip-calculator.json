{"p2":"Enter your total bill amount before tip. Select a standard tipping percentage (15%, 18%, 20%, or 25%) or input a custom percentage that reflects your service experience. If you're splitting the bill, specify how many people are sharing the cost. Tuttilo instantly shows the tip amount, the new total including tip, and how much each person owes if splitting. You can adjust the tip percentage in real-time to see how it affects your total. Your bill details stay private in your browser without being transmitted anywhere.","p3":"Restaurant diners quickly calculate appropriate tips after meals without mental math struggles. Groups splitting dinner bills use this to ensure everyone pays their fair share including tip. Travelers abroad convert local currency amounts and adjust tipping percentages for regional customs. Food delivery app users verify that suggested tips are reasonable before confirming their orders. Bar patrons running tabs throughout the evening calculate their final tip based on accumulated charges.","p4":"Tip on the pre-tax amount rather than the after-tax total to avoid tipping on government fees. In the United States, 20% has become the standard baseline for adequate service, with 15% reserved for subpar experiences and 25% for exceptional service. When using coupons or discounts, calculate your tip based on the original bill amount before reductions to fairly compensate servers. For takeout orders, 10% is generally appropriate since servers don't provide full table service but still package and prepare your order."}
