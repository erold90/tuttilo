{"p2":"Type or paste text into the input field and the tool instantly computes SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 hashes simultaneously. Each hash appears in its own output field with a copy button for quick clipboard access. The tool uses the browser's native Web Crypto API for fast, secure hashing with proper implementations of the SHA family algorithms. For file hashing, upload a file and the tool reads it as a binary buffer before computing hashes. All computation happens locally in your browser; no data is sent to servers.","p3":"Developers verify downloaded software packages by comparing computed SHA-256 hashes against official checksums to detect tampering or corruption. Security engineers hash passwords locally before testing authentication systems to avoid sending plaintext credentials. System administrators compare file hashes before and after transfers to confirm data integrity. DevOps engineers generate hashes of configuration files for version tracking and detecting unauthorized changes.","p4":"Use SHA-256 or higher for security applications; SHA-1 is cryptographically broken and should only be used for legacy compatibility. Hash values are deterministic, so the same input always produces the same hash, making them perfect for checksums but unsuitable for password storage without additional salt. When verifying download integrity, hash the entire file, not just a sample, since attackers can craft collisions in partial data. Copy hashes in lowercase or uppercase consistently since some verification tools are case-sensitive while the hash itself is the same.","seo":"Generate SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 hashes instantly.
