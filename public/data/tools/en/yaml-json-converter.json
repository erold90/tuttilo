{"p2":"Choose your direction then paste YAML or JSON into the input panel. For YAML inputs, the parser recognizes indentation-based structure, comments (which are stripped during conversion), anchors, and aliases. Converting to JSON produces strictly valid output with proper quoting and escaping. Going from JSON to YAML generates clean, readable output with appropriate indentation and minimal quoting. The tool handles common YAML features like multi-line strings and boolean variations (true/yes/on). Your configuration data is processed entirely client-side in the browser.","p3":"Kubernetes users frequently convert Helm chart values from YAML to JSON for programmatic validation or manipulation. CI/CD pipeline engineers debug GitHub Actions or GitLab CI files by converting YAML to JSON to understand structure. Developers migrating from Docker Compose to other orchestration tools need JSON versions of their service definitions. Infrastructure-as-code teams convert Ansible playbooks to JSON for processing with custom tooling or exporting to alternative formats.","p4":"YAML's implicit typing can surprise you—strings like 'no' or 'off' become booleans unless quoted. When converting JSON numbers to YAML, integers and floats are preserved, but scientific notation may render as strings. Use explicit string quoting in YAML (with single or double quotes) when values might be ambiguous. JSON doesn't support comments, so expect them to vanish in round-trip conversions. Indentation is semantic in YAML—always use spaces, never tabs, and maintain consistent depth (2 or 4 spaces)."}
