{"p2":"Paste your YouTube video URL, then configure embed options using the checkboxes and inputs: enable autoplay to start video immediately on page load, set loop to replay infinitely, mute audio by default (required for autoplay on most browsers), specify a start time in seconds to skip intros, hide video controls for cleaner embeds, and toggle responsive mode to generate fluid-width CSS. The tool builds the proper iframe embed code with all your options encoded as URL parameters. Copy the complete HTML and paste it into your webpage. All code generation happens in your browser.","p3":"Landing pages embed product demo videos with autoplay and mute enabled to create silent background video heroes that grab attention without disrupting the browsing experience. Blog posts embed tutorial videos with specific start times that skip intros and jump straight to the relevant instruction. Portfolio websites use hidden controls and loop settings for ambient background videos that play continuously without UI clutter. Online courses embed lecture videos with responsive sizing so they adapt properly to students watching on phones, tablets, or desktop computers.","p4":"Autoplay with sound only works when users have interacted with your site first — browsers block it otherwise to prevent annoying experiences. Always combine autoplay with mute to ensure reliable playback. The rel=0 parameter that once removed related videos no longer works; YouTube now only shows related videos from the same channel at video end. Start time uses seconds, not timestamps — for 1:30, enter 90 seconds. Responsive embeds require wrapper divs with specific aspect ratio CSS; copy the provided code exactly. Privacy-enhanced mode (using youtube-nocookie.com) prevents YouTube from tracking viewers until they play the video."}
