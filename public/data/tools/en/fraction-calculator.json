{"p2":"Enter two fractions using the numerator and denominator fields for each fraction. Select your desired operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Tuttilo instantly calculates the result, automatically simplifying to the lowest terms. You'll see the answer as both a proper or improper fraction and as a decimal. The tool also shows the calculation steps so you can understand how the result was derived. All math is performed in your browser without sending data to any server.","p3":"Students completing math homework verify their fraction arithmetic answers and check their work. Bakers scale recipes up or down by multiplying ingredient fractions by conversion factors. Woodworkers and crafters calculate precise measurements when dividing materials or combining dimensions. Pharmacists compute medication dosages that require fraction-based calculations. Teachers create fraction problems and verify answer keys for tests and worksheets.","p4":"When dividing fractions, remember to flip the second fraction (multiply by its reciprocal) rather than trying to divide numerators and denominators separately. Mixed numbers must be converted to improper fractions before performing operations—multiply the whole number by the denominator and add the numerator. Always simplify your final answer by finding the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator. For addition and subtraction, finding the least common denominator is essential—use the product of both denominators if you can't quickly identify a smaller common multiple."}
