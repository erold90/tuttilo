{"p2":"Pick your starting weight unit from options including metric (milligrams, grams, kilograms, tonnes) and imperial (ounces, pounds, stones). Type in your weight value. Select the unit you want to convert to, and Tuttilo shows the converted result immediately with full precision. This works for both small measurements like cooking ingredients and large weights like vehicle masses. The converter uses scientifically standard conversion ratios, and all processing happens client-side in your browser.","p3":"Cooks following international recipes convert ingredient weights from metric to imperial or vice versa. Postal workers and shipping departments calculate package weights in different units to determine shipping rates for domestic versus international carriers. Travelers weigh luggage to verify they meet airline limits specified in kilograms or pounds. Fitness enthusiasts track body weight when their scale displays units different from their tracking app's preferred format. Scientists conducting research convert weights to maintain consistency across papers using different measurement systems.","p4":"A pound (lb) is not the same as a pound mass (lbm) versus pound force (lbf) in technical contexts—this converter uses mass units. British stones (14 pounds each) are rarely used outside the UK and Ireland, but remain common for human body weight in those regions. When measuring precious metals or gems, troy ounces differ from standard (avoirdupois) ounces—use specialized converters for those applications. For cooking, remember that weight and volume conversions depend on ingredient density, so a cup of flour weighs far less than a cup of sugar despite identical volume."}
