{"p2":"Enter your password, a unique salt value, and configure the PBKDF2 parameters. Select the hash function (SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512), set the iteration count (higher is slower but more secure), and specify the output key length in bits. Click Generate to derive a cryptographic key from the password using the Web Crypto API's PBKDF2 implementation. The derived key displays as a hexadecimal string. Use this for password-based encryption systems where you need a consistent key derived from a user's password. All computation runs locally in your browser.","p3":"Developers implementing password-based encryption generate keys from user passwords for AES encryption without storing the actual password. Security engineers test password hashing implementations by generating expected outputs to compare against production systems. Backend developers derive database encryption keys from master passwords in applications that require transparent data encryption. Cryptography students learn how key derivation functions strengthen password-based security by experimenting with different parameters.","p4":"Use at least 100,000 iterations for modern security standards; OWASP recommends 600,000+ for PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256. The salt must be random and unique per user; never reuse salts or attackers can use precomputed rainbow tables. Store the salt alongside the derived key since you'll need it to re-derive the key from the password later. Higher iteration counts slow down brute force attacks but also slow down legitimate key derivation; balance security against user experience. Modern alternatives like Argon2 are preferred for new implementations, but PBKDF2 remains widely supported for legacy compatibility.","seo":"PBKDF2 Generator derives cryptographic keys from passwords using the PBKDF2 algorithm with configurable SHA hash, iteration count, salt, and output length."}
