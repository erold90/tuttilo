{"p2":"Choose your starting volume unit from a range including milliliters, liters, gallons (US and Imperial differ), cups, tablespoons, and teaspoons. Type your volume value. Select your target unit. Tuttilo converts the volume instantly using standard conversion ratios. The tool supports both cooking measurements and industrial volumes like cubic meters. Whether you're scaling recipes or calculating tank capacities, conversions happen immediately in your browser without sending data externally.","p3":"Home cooks convert recipe volumes when their measuring tools use different units than the cookbook. Bartenders scale cocktail recipes from ounces to milliliters for international menus. Aquarium hobbyists calculate water volume in gallons to determine appropriate filter sizes and chemical dosages. Chemical engineers convert process volumes between metric and imperial when working with international specifications. Pharmaceutical professionals measure medication dosages that require precise volume conversions for patient safety.","p4":"US gallons (3.785 liters) differ from UK/Imperial gallons (4.546 liters) by about 20%, so always verify which gallon type applies. A US cup is 236.6 mL while a metric cup is 250 mL—this small difference multiplies when scaling large recipes. Volume conversions don't account for ingredient density, so converting weight-based recipes (250g flour) to volume-based (cups) requires density-specific calculations. For precision applications, remember that fluid ounces measure volume while ounces measure weight—1 fluid ounce of water weighs approximately 1 ounce, but this relationship doesn't hold for other liquids."}
