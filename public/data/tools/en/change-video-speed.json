{"p2":"Upload a video and select a speed multiplier from the slider: values below 1.0 slow the video down, while values above 1.0 speed it up. Common presets include 0.5x for half-speed slow motion, 1.5x for moderate acceleration, and 2.0x for double-speed. The tool processes the video in your browser, adjusting frame timing and audio pitch proportionally. Preview a segment to ensure the speed change achieves your desired effect. Download the time-adjusted video when processing completes.","p3":"Tutorial viewers speed up slow-paced instructional videos to 1.5x or 2x to consume content faster while retaining comprehension. Sports analysts slow gameplay footage to 0.25x to study technique, form, or controversial referee calls frame by frame. Content creators accelerate timelapse-style videos of long processes like painting or construction to fit social media time limits. Educators slow complex demonstrations for students who need to observe details missed at normal speed. Vloggers speed up travel or routine sequences to maintain pacing without boring the audience.","p4":"Audio becomes chipmunk-pitched at high speeds or deep at slow speeds; plan to replace audio if the effect is unacceptable. Speed up by no more than 2x for speech content to maintain intelligibility, but feel free to accelerate silent or music-only videos more aggressively. Slow down to 0.5x or 0.25x only when analyzing specific moments, as viewers rarely watch entire slow-motion videos. Combine speed changes with trimming to isolate and emphasize key moments in long recordings. Check total video duration after speed changes to ensure it fits platform limits or presentation time slots."}
