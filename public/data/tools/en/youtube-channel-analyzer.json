{"p2":"Enter any YouTube channel URL or channel ID. The analyzer pulls comprehensive channel statistics via the YouTube API: total subscriber count, cumulative view count across all videos, total number of published videos, channel creation date, and calculated average views per video. Some channels hide subscriber counts for privacy; the tool displays this when available. Use the metrics to evaluate channel growth, benchmark your performance against competitors, or research potential collaboration partners. No authentication needed — just paste the URL and analyze. All processing happens in your browser.","p3":"Aspiring creators research established channels in their niche to set realistic growth expectations and understand how video quantity relates to subscriber counts. Brands vetting influencer partnerships verify subscriber claims and evaluate engagement rates by comparing subscribers to average views per video. Talent agents scouting content creators identify rising channels with strong view-to-subscriber ratios indicating high engagement and growth potential. Competitive analysts track competitor channel stats over time to monitor market share shifts in content niches.","p4":"Average views per video matters more than subscriber count — a channel with 10k subs averaging 15k views has better engagement than 100k subs averaging 2k views, indicating active audience or viral content. Channel age contexturalizes subscriber counts; 100k subs in one year is explosive growth while 100k over ten years is modest. Some channels buy subscribers, visible when subscriber count vastly exceeds view counts (ratio should be roughly 1:10 to 1:20 for healthy channels). Compare total views to video count to estimate effort required for similar results in your niche. Hidden subscriber counts often indicate smaller channels sensitive about appearing small or very large creators avoiding scrutiny."}
