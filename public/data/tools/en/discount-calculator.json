{"p2":"Enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage being offered. For multiple discounts (like a 20% off sale plus an additional 10% coupon), the calculator applies them sequentially to show the true final price. Optionally add sales tax to see your complete out-of-pocket cost. Tuttilo displays the discount amount, the sale price before tax, and the final total after tax. You can experiment with different discount scenarios instantly. Your shopping calculations remain private since everything processes in your browser.","p3":"Shoppers during Black Friday sales calculate whether advertised deals are genuinely worthwhile by seeing actual dollar savings. Retail employees help customers understand the final price when stacking store promotions with manufacturer coupons. Bargain hunters comparing prices across stores adjust for different discount amounts to find the true best deal. Business buyers evaluate bulk purchase discounts by calculating the effective price per unit after percentage reductions. Real estate agents help clients calculate net purchase prices after builder incentives and concessions.","p4":"Stacked discounts don't add together—a 20% discount followed by 10% off is actually 28% total savings, not 30%, because the second discount applies to the already-reduced price. Retailers strategically time sales, so comparing a 40% discount now against a potential 50% discount next month requires factoring in whether you truly need the item immediately. Be aware of anchor pricing tactics where original prices are inflated to make discounts seem more impressive. On high-value purchases, negotiating an extra 5% off can save more money than using a percentage-based credit card reward."}
