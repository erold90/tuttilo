{"p2":"Type or paste text into the input area and the tool converts it to a URL-friendly slug in real-time. Special characters, punctuation, and accents are removed or transliterated to ASCII equivalents. Spaces are replaced with your chosen separator (hyphen by default, underscore optional). Multiple consecutive spaces or separators are collapsed to a single separator. Leading and trailing separators are stripped. The output is lowercase by default (configurable). All slug generation happens instantly in your browser.","p3":"Bloggers convert article titles to URL slugs for SEO-friendly permalinks. E-commerce developers generate product URLs from product names with special characters or accents. CMS developers automatically create route-safe identifiers from user-input page titles. Developers building file upload systems sanitize filenames by converting them to slugs before storage.","p4":"Keep slugs short and meaningful—overly long URLs hurt user experience and may be truncated in search results. Remove stop words (like, the, a, and) manually for cleaner slugs, as most generators preserve them. Accented characters should transliterate (é → e), not vanish—verify your slug generator handles your language properly. Avoid underscores in URLs if you need Google to treat words separately; hyphens are preferred. Always generate slugs programmatically during content creation; don't let users type them manually without validation."}
