{"p2":"Type your plaintext message in the input field and create a strong password in the password field. Click Encrypt to transform your text using AES-256-GCM, a military-grade encryption standard. The tool derives a cryptographic key from your password using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations and a random salt. The encrypted output includes the salt, initialization vector, and ciphertext combined into a Base64-encoded string. To decrypt, paste the encrypted string, enter the same password, and click Decrypt. If the password is incorrect or the data is corrupted, decryption fails with an error. All cryptographic operations use the Web Crypto API in your browser.","p3":"Users securely share sensitive information like passwords or account details by encrypting the text, sending it through insecure channels like email, and sharing the decryption password separately through a different channel like SMS. Developers test encryption implementations by encrypting test data and verifying their application can decrypt it correctly. Security-conscious individuals encrypt notes containing confidential information before storing them in cloud note-taking apps. IT departments demonstrate encryption concepts during security training by letting employees encrypt and decrypt sample messages.","p4":"Choose a strong, unique password for encryption; weak passwords can be brute-forced regardless of AES strength. Never send the encrypted data and password through the same channel; if an attacker intercepts both, encryption is pointless. Save the entire encrypted output string including metadata; losing any part means you cannot decrypt the message. GCM mode provides authenticated encryption, so if someone tampers with the ciphertext, decryption will fail rather than producing garbage output. This tool is suitable for occasional manual encryption, but production applications should use proper key management systems rather than password-derived keys.","seo":"AES Encrypt/Decrypt uses AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) with PBKDF2 key derivation for secure text encryption and decryption."}
