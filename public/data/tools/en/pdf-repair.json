{"p2":"Upload corrupted PDFs that won't open in standard readers and the tool attempts two-stage recovery using pdf-lib and pdfjs-dist libraries. First, it tries to reconstruct the document structure and fix header corruption. If that fails, it attempts deeper recovery by extracting intact page content and rebuilding the file from recoverable elements. The success rate depends on the type and extent of corruption—complete recovery isn't always possible for severely damaged files. All repair attempts process locally in your browser, keeping potentially corrupted documents containing sensitive information private on your device.","p3":"IT professionals recover project documentation PDFs corrupted during failed disk recovery operations. Students repair thesis drafts damaged when systems crashed during saving. Archivists attempt to recover historical PDF documents degraded by bit rot on aging storage media. Legal teams recover corrupted case file PDFs before critical filing deadlines when backups aren't available. Finance departments repair damaged invoice PDFs received from vendors with transmission errors or storage issues.","p4":"Always keep original corrupted files until you verify repaired versions are complete and usable—the repair process might recover partial content but lose some pages or formatting. If initial repair fails, try converting the corrupted PDF to images first using a different tool, which might preserve visual content even if structural repair isn't possible. For important documents, consider professional data recovery services if automated repair fails, especially for legal records or irreplaceable archives. Regular backups prevent corruption disasters—this tool should be a last resort rather than a substitute for proper file management. Check that all pages, images, and formatting survived the repair process before discarding the corrupted original."}
