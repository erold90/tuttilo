{"p2":"Set the desired number of columns and rows using the dimension controls, then click Generate Grid to create an editable table. Type directly into each cell—the tool handles text wrapping and cell sizing automatically. Choose left, center, or right alignment for each column using the alignment buttons. As you edit, the Markdown output panel updates in real-time showing the properly formatted table syntax. Copy the Markdown output and paste it directly into your README, GitHub issue, or documentation. The generator produces pipe-style tables compatible with GitHub Flavored Markdown. All generation occurs locally in your browser.","p3":"Open source maintainers create comparison matrices for README files listing framework features across versions. Technical writers build structured data tables for API documentation without memorizing pipe and hyphen syntax. Students format research data into tables for GitHub Pages blog posts. Developers document test case matrices showing input/output combinations for function specifications in markdown-based wikis.","p4":"Use header rows for column titles and ensure they're meaningful—screen readers and parsers rely on them for context. Set alignment before entering data to preview how numbers or text will appear in the rendered output. Keep cell content concise; excessively long text in table cells breaks layout in many Markdown renderers. If you need complex formatting within cells (like inline code), test the rendered output in your target platform first. Save common table structures as templates by copying the raw Markdown for reuse."}
