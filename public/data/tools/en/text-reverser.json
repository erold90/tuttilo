{"p2":"Paste text into the input area and choose your reversal mode: by character (entire string backwards), by word (words in reverse order but characters normal), or by line (lines in reverse order). Click Reverse and the transformed text appears immediately. Character reversal produces mirror text (Hello → olleH). Word reversal reorders words while preserving spelling (Hello World → World Hello). Line reversal is useful for log files or lists. All three modes preserve original spacing and punctuation behavior. Processing is instant and client-side.","p3":"Developers test string manipulation functions by providing reversed input as edge cases. Puzzle creators generate reversed text for riddles or cryptographic challenges. Educators create dyslexia awareness exercises by showing text in reversed character order. Data entry workers reverse accidentally copied text that was pasted in the wrong direction (happens with right-to-left languages).","p4":"Character reversal breaks multi-byte Unicode characters like emoji—verify output manually if your text contains non-ASCII symbols. Word reversal depends on whitespace as delimiters; punctuation attached to words moves with them. Line reversal is perfect for analyzing stack traces or logs where the most recent entries are last. Use word reversal to create language-learning exercises where students reconstruct sentence order. Reversing already-reversed text should return the original—if it doesn't, encoding issues are present."}
