Everything processes locally in your browser without uploading voice data to any server.","p3":"Students record lecture notes or study reminders verbally instead of typing, especially while commuting or multitasking. Content creators capture voice memos for podcast intros, video narration scripts, or song lyric ideas. Remote workers record voice messages for asynchronous team communication when text feels too impersonal. Language learners practice pronunciation by recording and listening back to their speech patterns. Interviewers record phone or in-person conversations with consent for transcription or reference later.","p4":"Position your microphone 6-12 inches from your mouth to balance volume and avoid breath noises or plosives. Record in a quiet environment and close windows, turn off fans, and silence phone notifications before starting. Use the pause button liberally to eliminate dead air, awkward silences, or interruptions. Monitor the waveform while recording; if it flatlines or clips at the top, adjust microphone level or distance. Save recordings immediately after stopping to avoid accidental data loss from browser crashes or tab closures."}
