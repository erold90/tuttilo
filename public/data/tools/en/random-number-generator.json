{"p2":"Set your desired minimum and maximum range values using the number inputs. Specify how many random numbers you want to generate in a single batch. Choose whether you want unique numbers only (no duplicates) or allow repetition. Optionally enable sorting to display results in ascending order rather than random sequence. Click generate to produce your random numbers using JavaScript's cryptographically secure random number generator. All computation happens in your browser with no server requests. The results appear immediately for copying or further use in your application or decision-making process.","p3":"Teachers create randomized student seating charts or select participants for classroom activities without bias. Raffle organizers generate winning ticket numbers transparently during prize drawings and giveaways. Game developers test random mechanics by generating sample data sets to verify distribution evenness. Researchers assign participants to control or treatment groups using random number sequences for experimental study designs.","p4":"For cryptographic or security purposes, use the unique-only option to prevent predictable patterns in generated sequences. Generate more numbers than you need and pick from the middle of the list to avoid any potential edge biases. Test your range carefully—remember that inclusive ranges include both endpoints, so 1-10 generates eleven possible values (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10). When generating large batches, verify your maximum range is large enough to accommodate the quantity if you've enabled unique numbers. Save or copy your results immediately since refreshing the page generates a completely new set.","p5":"Yes, this tool uses JavaScript's crypto.getRandomValues() API which provides cryptographically secure random numbers suitable for security-sensitive applications. It's far superior to the older Math.random() function for any situation requiring true randomness."}
