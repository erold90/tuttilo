{"p2":"Click anywhere in the color picker gradient to select a hue and saturation, then adjust the brightness slider on the right. The selected color displays at the top with live color values in multiple formats. Copy the HEX code for CSS and HTML, the RGB values for programmatic color manipulation, the HSL representation for adjusting lightness, or rgba/hsla with alpha transparency. You can also paste any HEX code into the input field to jump directly to that color. The CMYK values help when preparing designs for print. All conversions calculate instantly in your browser.","p3":"UI/UX designers select brand colors and generate exact values for design systems and style guides. Frontend developers pick colors for CSS while building components, copying the format needed for their specific context. Graphic designers convert screen colors to CMYK before sending designs to print vendors who require print-optimized color spaces. Marketing teams ensure brand color consistency across digital assets by referencing canonical HEX codes rather than eyeballing colors.","p4":"When designing for accessibility, verify your color combinations meet WCAG contrast ratios using a separate contrast checker after picking colors here. HSL format is particularly useful for programmatically generating color variations since you can adjust lightness and saturation while keeping the base hue constant. Remember that colors appear differently on screens versus print, so CMYK values are approximations; request color proofs from your print vendor for critical brand materials. Save your project's color palette in a text file or design tool since browser tools don't persist selections.","seo":"Pick any color and instantly get HEX, RGB, HSL and CSS values.
