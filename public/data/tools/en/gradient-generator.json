{"p2":"Choose your gradient type — linear, radial, or conic — then click to add color stops along the gradient path. Drag each stop to adjust its position, and click the color swatch to pick your desired hue using the built-in color picker. For linear gradients, rotate the angle slider to control direction from 0° (bottom to top) through 180° (top to bottom). Radial gradients let you center focus, while conic gradients create color wheel effects. Copy the complete CSS code with one click and paste it directly into your stylesheet or inline styles.","p3":"Web designers create hero section backgrounds with subtle two-tone gradients that add depth without overwhelming content. UI developers build button hover states using linear gradients from lighter to darker shades for visual feedback. Marketing teams design eye-catching call-to-action banners with vibrant multi-stop gradients that draw attention on landing pages. Mobile app designers use radial gradients to create spotlight effects that guide users' eyes toward important interface elements or promotional content.","p4":"Limit gradients to 2-4 color stops for clean, professional results — too many colors create muddy transitions. When designing for readability, ensure sufficient contrast between gradient and overlaid text by testing at both extremes of the color range. For subtle depth effects, use gradients between shades of the same hue rather than jumping between different colors. Radial gradients with positioned centers (using at x% y% syntax) create dramatic spotlight effects perfect for hero sections. Export your favorite gradients as CSS custom properties to maintain consistency across components and enable theme switching."}
