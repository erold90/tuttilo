{"p2":"Pick your base color using the color picker or enter a hex value, then select one of six color harmony rules: complementary for high contrast, analogous for smooth transitions, triadic for balanced vibrancy, split-complementary for sophisticated contrast, tetradic for complex schemes, or monochromatic for elegant single-hue variations. The generator instantly displays your palette with all color values shown in hex, RGB, and HSL formats. Click any color to copy its value, or use the lock feature to preserve colors while regenerating the rest. Processing happens entirely in your browser using color theory mathematics.","p3":"Brand designers establishing visual identity systems use triadic or tetradic schemes to create comprehensive palettes with primary, secondary, and accent colors for logos, marketing materials, and digital properties. Interior designers rely on analogous palettes when selecting paint, fabrics, and decor that harmonize naturally within a room. Web developers building dark mode interfaces use monochromatic schemes from a base color to generate consistent shades for backgrounds, panels, and UI elements. Presentation creators employ complementary schemes to make key data points pop against slide backgrounds without clashing.","p4":"Complementary colors (opposite on the color wheel) provide maximum contrast but can vibrate unpleasantly when placed side-by-side at full saturation — reduce intensity for better balance. Analogous schemes work best when you designate one color as dominant and use the others as accents in 60-30-10 proportions. Triadic palettes feel most balanced when one color dominates while the other two serve supporting roles. Before finalizing any palette, test it with the contrast checker to ensure text legibility meets WCAG standards. Export successful palettes as CSS variables or design tokens to maintain consistency across your entire project."}
