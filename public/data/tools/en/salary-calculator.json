{"p2":"Enter either your annual salary or hourly wage rate—Tuttilo automatically converts between the two formats. The calculator assumes a standard 40-hour work week and 52 weeks per year (2,080 hours annually). You'll instantly see breakdowns by year, month, week, day, and hour. While the tool provides pre-tax estimates, you can get a rough sense of take-home pay by factoring in your tax bracket separately. All calculations happen directly in your browser, so your compensation information remains private between you and your device.","p3":"Job seekers compare salary offers from different employers that quote compensation in different formats (hourly versus salaried). Freelancers determine appropriate hourly rates by working backward from their desired annual income and expected billable hours. Employees negotiating raises calculate the hourly value of proposed salary increases. Part-time workers transitioning to full-time positions project their annual earnings based on their current hourly rate.","p4":"Remember that salaried positions often include benefits worth 20-30% of base salary, so compare total compensation packages rather than just the numbers. When freelancing, your hourly rate should be significantly higher than an equivalent salaried position to account for self-employment taxes, lack of benefits, and non-billable administrative time. Consider that hourly workers may have variable hours while salaried employees often work beyond 40 hours without additional pay. Geographic location dramatically affects real purchasing power, so a $60,000 salary in a low-cost area may provide better quality of life than $90,000 in an expensive city."}
