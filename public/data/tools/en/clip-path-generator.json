{"p2":"Choose from eight shape presets: circle, ellipse, inset rectangle, triangle, pentagon, hexagon, star, or arrow. Each shape offers adjustable parameters via sliders — circle and ellipse let you control size and position, inset adjusts how much to cut from each edge, and polygon shapes have point-specific controls. The preview updates instantly showing exactly how your shape will mask content. Copy the generated clip-path CSS property and apply it to any element to crop it to your custom shape. Everything processes locally for privacy.","p3":"Hero sections use clipped diagonal edges created with polygon clip-paths to break away from rectangular monotony and create dynamic page transitions between sections. Profile pictures get creative shapes beyond simple circles — hexagons for tech brands, stars for gaming sites, or custom polygons for unique branding. Image galleries clip hover overlays into interesting shapes that reveal portions of underlying images for interactive exploration. Infographic designers use clip-path to create custom callout shapes, badges, and ribbon effects that pure CSS rectangles can't achieve.","p4":"Clip-path cuts content but doesn't affect layout — the element still occupies its full rectangular box, so plan spacing accordingly. For responsive designs, use percentage-based inset values rather than fixed pixels so shapes scale with container size. Remember that clip-path clips both the element and its background but not box-shadow, which can create unexpected visual artifacts. Complex polygon shapes with many points can hurt performance; simplify to the minimum points needed. Combine clip-path with transitions to create morphing effects between shapes on hover or state changes."}
