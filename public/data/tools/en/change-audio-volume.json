{"p2":"Upload an audio file with volume too quiet or too loud. Use the slider to select a volume multiplier: values below 100% reduce volume, while values above increase it up to 400% for significantly quieter recordings. The tool applies gain adjustment to every sample in the waveform, processing entirely in your browser without uploading. Preview the adjusted audio to check for clipping or distortion at higher boost levels. Download the volume-adjusted file when the level sounds appropriate.","p3":"Podcasters boost quiet guest recordings to match host volume levels for consistent listening across episodes. Musicians normalize track volumes so all songs in an album or playlist play at similar perceived loudness. Phone recorders amplify distant voice memos captured from across a room or in noisy environments. Audio editors reduce overly loud sections that cause listener fatigue or speaker distortion. Content creators match background music volume to dialogue so neither element overpowers the other in video soundtracks.","p4":"Watch for clipping when boosting volume above 200%, indicated by distorted peaks or a flattened waveform at max amplitude. Normalize your audio first using editing software, then fine-tune with volume adjustment to avoid destroying dynamic range. Apply volume reduction instead of compression when you need simpler loudness control without affecting dynamics. For speech, boost to -16 dB LUFS for podcast standards or -14 dB for broadcast specs. Combine volume adjustment with EQ or noise reduction for professional results, especially on low-quality source recordings."}
