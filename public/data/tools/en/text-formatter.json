{"p2":"Paste or type text into the input area and select operations from the available formatting buttons. You can remove extra whitespace to clean up messy text, sort lines alphabetically or numerically, eliminate duplicate lines, or add line numbers to each row. Additional options let you add custom prefixes or suffixes to every line, change case to uppercase or lowercase, and trim leading or trailing spaces. Multiple operations can be applied in sequence. The formatted result appears in a separate output box that you can copy with one click.","p3":"Programmers cleaning up list-based data files use this to remove duplicate imports or configuration entries. Writers working with transcripts apply case transformations and remove extra spacing from speech-to-text output that tends to be inconsistently formatted. System administrators sort log file entries or configuration lists alphabetically to spot outliers or compare two configs manually. Data entry clerks add prefixes like bullet points or numbering to lists before pasting into documents.","p4":"When sorting lines that contain numbers, check whether you need alphabetical or numerical sorting; '10' comes before '2' alphabetically but after it numerically. Before removing duplicates, consider whether case matters for your use case and normalize the case first if needed. Use the prefix/suffix feature to quickly wrap each line in quotation marks or array syntax when preparing data for code. Save frequently used formatting workflows as browser bookmarks with a descriptive name so you can quickly repeat multi-step transformations."}
