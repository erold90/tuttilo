{"p2":"Choose whether you want to add VAT to a net price or remove VAT from a gross price that already includes tax. Select a common VAT rate for your region (such as 20% for the UK or 19% for Germany) or input any custom tax percentage. Enter your amount and Tuttilo instantly calculates the result, showing the VAT portion separately from the base amount. This works for sales tax, GST, or any percentage-based tax system. Your transaction details are processed entirely in your browser for complete privacy.","p3":"Small business owners price their products by adding VAT to their base costs to determine customer-facing prices. Accountants reconcile invoices by removing VAT from gross receipts to calculate net revenue for tax filings. Shoppers traveling internationally compare prices by removing different VAT rates to find the true product cost. Freelancers invoicing clients in different countries apply the correct VAT rate for each jurisdiction. Online sellers calculate the inclusive price to display to customers when their e-commerce platform requires tax-inclusive pricing.","p4":"Always clarify whether quoted prices are VAT-inclusive or exclusive before making business deals to avoid miscommunication about final costs. In the EU, B2B transactions often use reverse charge mechanisms where VAT isn't added, while B2C sales must include VAT. Keep detailed records of both net and gross amounts on all invoices for accurate tax reporting. Digital services often have complex VAT rules depending on the customer's location rather than your business location—verify the correct rate applies before invoicing international clients."}
