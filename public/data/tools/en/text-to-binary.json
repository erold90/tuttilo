{"p2":"Type or paste text into the input area and select your target format: binary (base-2), hexadecimal (base-16), octal (base-8), or decimal (UTF-8 code points). The tool converts each character to its numeric representation instantly. For binary output, each character becomes an 8-bit sequence (like 01001000 for 'H'). Hex output uses two-digit notation (48 for 'H'). Reverse conversion works too—paste binary digits and get back the original text. All encoding happens client-side in your browser.","p3":"Computer science students learning about character encoding convert strings to binary to understand how text is stored in memory. Network engineers troubleshoot protocol issues by examining hex dumps of packet data. Developers implementing custom serialization formats convert strings to numeric representations for compact storage. Cryptography enthusiasts analyze bit patterns in text before applying encryption algorithms.","p4":"UTF-8 encoding means multi-byte characters (like emoji) produce longer binary sequences than ASCII characters. Binary output can be space-separated or continuous—choose based on whether you need to parse it programmatically or read it visually. Hexadecimal is the most compact human-readable format; use it for displaying raw byte data. When converting binary back to text, ensure proper byte alignment—each character needs exactly 8 bits. Non-printable characters may not render visibly in the text output; check code points to verify conversion accuracy."}
