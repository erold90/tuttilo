{"p2":"Choose between two calculation modes: finding the difference between two specific dates, or adding/subtracting a time period from a starting date. For difference calculations, select both start and end dates using the calendar pickers. For addition/subtraction, choose your base date and specify how many years, months, weeks, or days to add or remove. The calculator displays detailed results showing total time in years, months, weeks, days, hours, and minutes. All computation happens in your browser with no external requests. The tool handles leap years, month-length variations, and daylight saving transitions automatically.","p3":"Project managers calculate exact durations between milestone dates to create accurate timeline estimates and deadline tracking. Pregnant individuals count days until their due date while tracking weeks completed for medical appointments. Legal professionals compute statute of limitations periods, filing deadlines, and compliance timeframes with precision. Event planners determine how many weeks remain before conferences to schedule preparation tasks and vendor deadlines appropriately.","p4":"When adding months to a date, remember that results depend on day-of-month handling—adding one month to January 31st gives you February 28th (or 29th), not March 3rd. For business day calculations, manually subtract weekends and holidays since standard date math counts all calendar days. Use the detailed breakdown to choose the most appropriate unit—90 days sounds more urgent than 3 months in project communications. Verify timezone assumptions when calculating across geographic boundaries to avoid off-by-one errors at midnight boundaries.","p5":"Yes, the calculator automatically accounts for leap years when calculating date ranges or adding/subtracting years. February 29th is correctly handled in all calculations involving leap year dates."}
