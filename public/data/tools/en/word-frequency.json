{"p2":"Paste text into the input area and the analyzer counts every word's occurrence. Results are displayed in descending order by frequency, showing count and percentage of total words. Each word gets a visual bar representing its relative frequency. You can filter out common stop words (the, a, is) to focus on meaningful content words. Case sensitivity is optional—enable it to treat \"Word\" and \"word\" as distinct. Minimum word length filters remove short words like \"I\" or \"a\". Analysis runs entirely in your browser.","p3":"Content writers analyze keyword density in articles to optimize SEO without over-stuffing. Students studying literature identify recurring themes by finding the most frequent meaningful words. Customer service teams analyze support ticket text to identify common complaint topics. Social media managers evaluate brand mentions and sentiment by examining word frequency in collected comments or reviews.","p4":"Enable stop word filtering to surface meaningful patterns—\"the\" appearing 500 times tells you nothing useful. Case-insensitive mode is usually better for semantic analysis; case-sensitive matters only when distinguishing proper nouns. Set a minimum word length (3-4 characters) to exclude articles and prepositions that inflate counts. Combine word frequency with context—high frequency of \"not\" or \"no\" might indicate negative sentiment. Export the frequency list for further analysis in spreadsheet tools or data visualization software."}
