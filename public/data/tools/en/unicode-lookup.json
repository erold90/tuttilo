{"p2":"Type or paste any character into the input field and the tool displays its Unicode properties: official name, code point (U+XXXX), hexadecimal value, UTF-8 byte sequence, UTF-16 encoding, and HTML entity (both decimal &#N; and named &entity; if available). Properties also include the Unicode block (Latin, CJK, Emoji, etc.) and character category. For multi-character input, each character is analyzed separately. The lookup is instant and uses browser-native Unicode data.","p3":"Developers troubleshoot encoding issues by identifying which character caused UTF-8 decode errors in logs. Technical writers find HTML entities for special symbols like copyright ©, trademark ™, or currency symbols. Linguists analyze text samples to identify script systems and character sets. Security researchers detect homograph attacks by inspecting visually similar characters from different Unicode blocks (like Cyrillic o vs. Latin o).","p4":"Code points above U+FFFF require surrogate pairs in UTF-16—emoji and rare CJK characters fall into this range. HTML named entities exist only for common symbols; use decimal/hex entities for comprehensive coverage. UTF-8 byte length varies (1-4 bytes per character)—this matters for byte-based string length limits in databases or protocols. Zero-width characters (U+200B, U+FEFF) won't display visibly but affect text processing. Check the character category (Letter, Symbol, Punctuation) to understand why certain characters behave unexpectedly in regex or sorting."}
