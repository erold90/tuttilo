{"p2":"Configure container properties using the visual controls: flex-direction switches between row and column layouts, flex-wrap determines whether items stay on one line or wrap to multiple lines, justify-content aligns items along the main axis, align-items positions them on the cross axis, and gap sets spacing between flex children. Add or remove preview items to see how your layout adapts to different content quantities. The live preview updates instantly as you adjust each property, and the generated CSS shows both the container and item rules ready to copy into your project.","p3":"Navigation bars use flexbox with space-between justification to push logo left and menu items right without manual positioning calculations. Card grids employ flex-wrap with gap spacing to create responsive galleries that automatically reflow at different screen widths without media queries. Form layouts utilize flex-direction: column for mobile and switch to row for desktop to stack labels above inputs on small screens. Dashboard widgets align icons and text using align-items: center to vertically center content regardless of varying text heights or icon sizes.","p4":"Start with justify-content for main axis alignment (horizontal in row, vertical in column) and align-items for cross axis — this mental model prevents confusion. Use gap instead of margins on flex children for spacing since it won't add extra space at container edges. flex-wrap: wrap enables responsive behavior without media queries when combined with flex-basis or min-width on children. Remember that align-content only affects multi-line flex containers, not single lines. For equal-width columns, set flex: 1 on children; for content-based sizing, use flex: 0 1 auto to prevent shrinking."}
