{"p2":"Add your first shadow layer with the plus button, then adjust horizontal offset (X), vertical offset (Y), blur radius, and spread using the sliders or direct input. Pick your shadow color and set its opacity using the alpha slider. Toggle between outer shadows (default) and inset shadows for inner glow effects. Add multiple shadow layers to create complex depth effects — each layer stacks on top of previous ones. Preview updates instantly as you adjust any parameter, and the CSS output reflects your complete shadow declaration ready to copy into your stylesheets.","p3":"Card-based UI designers add subtle shadows to elevate content cards above page backgrounds, creating hierarchy that guides users through information architecture. E-commerce sites use pronounced shadows on product images and 'Add to Cart' buttons to make them appear tactile and clickable. Dashboard builders layer multiple shadows with different blur radii to achieve realistic material design depth levels — one sharp shadow for definition plus a softer shadow for ambient lighting. Creative agencies design dramatic hover effects by animating shadow properties, making interface elements appear to lift off the page when users interact.","p4":"Layer shadows from largest/softest (bottom) to smallest/sharpest (top) to mimic natural lighting where ambient light creates soft shadows and direct light creates defined edges. Keep spread values minimal (0-4px) — excessive spread makes shadows look artificial and cartoon-like. For realistic depth, position the main shadow slightly below and to the right (positive X and Y) simulating light from upper-left, a convention users expect. Inset shadows work beautifully for input fields to create recessed appearances. Use semi-transparent black (rgba(0,0,0,0.1-0.3)) for most shadows rather than pure black, which looks harsh."}
