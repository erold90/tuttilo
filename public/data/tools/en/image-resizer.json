{"p2":"Upload your image and choose from preset dimensions for Instagram posts, Facebook covers, Twitter headers, or YouTube thumbnails. Alternatively, enter custom width and height values in pixels. Toggle the aspect ratio lock to maintain proportions or disable it to stretch the image to exact dimensions. The tool processes everything in your browser using canvas API, so your photos never leave your device. Download the resized image instantly as PNG or JPEG.","p3":"Content creators resize images to meet platform-specific requirements: Instagram posts need 1080×1080px squares, while Twitter headers require 1500×500px. E-commerce sellers optimize product photos to load faster on mobile devices by reducing dimensions to 800×800px or smaller. Web developers resize hero images to fit responsive layouts without distorting the composition. Graphic designers prepare assets for print by scaling mockups to exact CMYK output dimensions.","p4":"Always work with the highest resolution original you have, since resizing creates new pixels through interpolation. When reducing size dramatically, do it in steps rather than one jump to preserve detail. For social media, export at exactly the platform's recommended dimensions to avoid automatic cropping or compression. Lock aspect ratio when resizing photos to prevent distortion, but unlock it for banners or headers where stretching is intentional. Save bandwidth-heavy images as JPEG and graphics with transparency as PNG."}
