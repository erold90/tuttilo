{"p2":"Choose your source temperature scale (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin) and enter your temperature value. Select the target scale you want to convert to. Tuttilo instantly calculates and displays the equivalent temperature in the chosen scale. The conversion uses the standard formulas: Fahrenheit = (Celsius × 9/5) + 32, Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15. You can convert between any two scales directly. All calculations happen in your browser, so your data stays private.","p3":"Travelers checking weather forecasts convert Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit to understand what clothing to pack. Cooks follow recipes from other countries by converting oven temperatures to their appliance's scale. Science students complete physics and chemistry homework requiring conversions between absolute (Kelvin) and relative (Celsius/Fahrenheit) scales. HVAC technicians set thermostat systems when replacing units that use different temperature displays. International business professionals prepare for video calls by checking weather in colleagues' cities using their preferred temperature units.","p4":"Celsius and Fahrenheit intersect at -40°, where -40°C equals -40°F—a useful reference point. Water freezes at 0°C (32°F) and boils at 100°C (212°F) at sea level, making Celsius intuitively aligned with water's phase changes. Kelvin has no negative values since it starts at absolute zero (-273.15°C), making it ideal for scientific calculations. For mental approximation, remember that a Celsius degree is 1.8 times larger than a Fahrenheit degree, so Celsius temperatures change less dramatically in everyday weather observations."}
