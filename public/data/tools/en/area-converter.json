{"p2":"Select your source area unit from options like square meters, square feet, acres, or hectares. Enter your area measurement. Choose the unit you want to convert to. Tuttilo calculates the conversion immediately, using precise mathematical relationships between units. This handles both small areas like rooms and large parcels like farms. The converter works with metric, imperial, and specialized units like acres and hectares. All computations happen in your browser for instant results without data transmission.","p3":"Real estate agents convert property lot sizes between acres and square feet for listings targeting different buyer preferences. Gardeners plan landscaping projects by converting yard measurements into square meters to order mulch or sod. Farmers calculate field sizes in hectares for agricultural subsidy applications that require metric reporting. Homeowners estimate flooring or paint needs by converting room dimensions into square footage for material purchases. Urban planners translate land parcels between measurement systems when reviewing international development proposals.","p4":"An acre is defined as 43,560 square feet, approximately the area you can plow with an ox in one day—remember this as a rough visualization. Hectares (10,000 square meters) align cleanly with the metric system, making calculations simpler than acres. When converting between square units, remember to square the linear conversion factor (1 meter = 3.28 feet, so 1 m² = 10.76 ft²). For irregularly shaped plots, break the area into rectangles or triangles before measuring to improve accuracy, then sum the areas after converting units."}
