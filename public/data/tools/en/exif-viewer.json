{"p2":"Select a JPEG or TIFF image file from your device using the file picker. The tool reads the embedded EXIF metadata tags directly from the binary file structure without uploading anything to a server. Within seconds, you'll see extracted data organized into categories: camera information (make, model, lens), capture settings (ISO, aperture, shutter speed, focal length), date and time taken, GPS coordinates if available, and other technical metadata. The raw GPS coordinates can be copied or clicked to open the location in mapping services. All processing happens entirely in your browser using JavaScript binary parsing libraries.","p3":"Photographers verify camera settings for shots they want to replicate or understand how a particular photo was captured. Privacy-conscious users check images for GPS location data before sharing on social media to prevent doxxing. Digital forensics investigators extract metadata to verify image authenticity and creation timestamps. Real estate photographers confirm geolocation data is embedded before uploading listings. Photo organizers sort images by camera model or date when filenames don't provide useful information. Travelers view GPS coordinates from old photos to remember where specific pictures were taken.","p4":"Smartphone photos often contain more EXIF data than you expect, including precise GPS coordinates—always check before posting images online. Many social platforms strip EXIF data during upload, but email, messaging apps, and file sharing often preserve it. Editing a photo in most software preserves the original EXIF unless you explicitly remove it during export. GPS coordinates in EXIF use decimal degrees format (latitude/longitude)—copy these carefully if navigating. For privacy, use EXIF removal tools before sharing images that might reveal home or work locations. Professional cameras embed more technical data than smartphones, making EXIF especially useful for learning photographic techniques.","p5":"The viewer parses the EXIF segment from JPEG files using the APP1 marker format defined in the EXIF specification. Tag values are decoded based on their data type (ASCII, short, long, rational) using proper byte order (endianness) indicated by the TIFF header. GPS coordinates are stored as rational values (degrees, minutes, seconds) and converted to decimal degrees for display. Date/time values follow the format YYYY:MM:DD HH:MM:SS and are extracted as-is from the DateTimeOriginal tag. The tool supports both big-endian and little-endian TIFF byte ordering for cross-platform compatibility."}
