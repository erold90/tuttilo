{"p2":"Select a video file containing the audio you want to extract. The tool loads the video in your browser and separates the audio track from the visual component using media stream APIs. Processing happens locally without uploading to any server. Once extraction completes, download the audio as an MP3 file, preserving the original bitrate and sample rate when possible. The video file remains unchanged on your device. Extraction time depends on video length and your computer's processing power.","p3":"Music fans extract audio from music video downloads to build MP3 libraries for offline listening in car stereos or music players. Podcast listeners convert video podcast episodes to audio-only MP3s for smaller file sizes and compatibility with audio-focused apps. Language learners isolate dialogue tracks from foreign films to create listening comprehension practice files. DJs rip audio from performance videos to remix or sample in production software. Researchers convert lecture or interview videos to audio for easier note-taking and transcription.","p4":"Verify the video has an actual audio track before processing; screen recordings or silent clips will produce empty MP3 files. Higher bitrate source videos yield better MP3 quality, so extract from 1080p or higher when possible. For music extraction, avoid videos with introductions or outros unless you trim the video first. Use dedicated audio compression tools after extraction if the MP3 file is too large for your needs. Check the sample rate and bitrate of the extracted MP3 if you plan to edit or mix it with other audio files."}
