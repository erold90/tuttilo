{"p2":"Select your starting pressure unit from Pascal, kilopascal, bar, atmosphere, PSI (pounds per square inch), millimeters of mercury, or Torr. Enter your pressure value. Choose the unit you want to convert to. Tuttilo calculates the conversion instantly using scientifically precise relationships between pressure units. This handles everything from atmospheric pressure to high-pressure industrial applications. All calculations run in your browser, protecting your technical data's privacy.","p3":"Automotive technicians convert tire pressure specifications between PSI and bar when servicing vehicles with international spec sheets. Meteorologists translate atmospheric pressure between millibars and inches of mercury for weather forecasting across different reporting standards. Scuba divers calculate depth-related pressure changes when diving equipment displays units different from training materials. HVAC engineers verify system pressures when equipment specifications use different standards than local regulations require. Laboratory scientists standardize pressure measurements across international research collaborations.","p4":"Standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined as 101.325 kPa, 1.01325 bar, 1 atm, 14.7 PSI, or 760 mmHg—memorize your field's standard for quick reference checks. Gauge pressure measures relative to atmospheric pressure while absolute pressure measures relative to perfect vacuum—verify which type your measurement uses. Tire pressure specifications account for the tire's load-bearing requirements and operating temperature, so don't rely solely on unit conversion without understanding the engineering context. Pascal is the SI unit but impractically small for everyday use, which explains why kilopascals and bars dominate practical applications."}
