{"p2":"Select where you want page numbers to appear (top or bottom, left, center, or right) and configure the starting number and format style. The tool adds numbers to all pages consistently, using a font size and style that complements your document. You can exclude the first page if it's a cover sheet or begin numbering from a specific page in the middle of the document. All page numbering happens in your browser, keeping documents containing proprietary information or confidential content private on your device during the numbering process.","p3":"Students add page numbers to thesis drafts to meet university formatting requirements before final submission. Lawyers number exhibit pages in case filings to comply with court document formatting rules. Technical writers add page numbers to user manuals so support teams can reference specific pages during customer troubleshooting calls. Event planners number conference program PDFs to help attendees navigate session schedules and venue maps. HR departments add page numbers to employee handbooks to facilitate easier reference during policy discussions and training sessions.","p4":"Check existing page numbers before adding new ones to avoid creating duplicates if some pages already have numbering. For documents that will be printed and bound, position numbers with sufficient margin clearance to prevent trimming during the binding process. If your document has distinct sections requiring different numbering styles (like Roman numerals for front matter), consider splitting the PDF, numbering sections separately, then merging them back together. Choose font sizes large enough to be legible but not so prominent that they distract from page content. Preview several pages across the document before finalizing to ensure consistent placement, especially if pages have varying content layouts."}
