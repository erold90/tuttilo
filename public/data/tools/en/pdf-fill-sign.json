{"p2":"Click on any form field to type responses directly into text boxes, checkboxes, and dropdown menus without printing the document. The signature feature lets you draw your signature using a mouse or trackpad, type your name in script font, or upload an image of your handwritten signature saved from a previous signing. Position signatures and initials precisely where required by dragging them to the appropriate lines. Since form filling and signing happen entirely in your browser, sensitive information like social security numbers, bank account details, or medical data never gets transmitted to external servers during the process.","p3":"Remote employees sign employment contracts, non-disclosure agreements, and direct deposit authorization forms for new jobs without printing or mailing physical paperwork. Parents complete school permission slips, emergency contact forms, and field trip waivers electronically before deadlines. Loan applicants fill out mortgage pre-qualification forms and sign disclosure documents from home instead of visiting bank branches. Medical patients complete intake questionnaires and HIPAA consent forms before telehealth appointments. Freelancers sign client service agreements and project proposals while negotiating terms via email, eliminating delays from postal delivery.","p4":"Create a reusable signature image once and save it separately for quick insertion into future documents rather than redrawing each time. Before signing important contracts, read the entire document carefully—the convenience of digital signing shouldn't rush critical decisions. For forms with many fields, tab through entries systematically to avoid skipping required information that could invalidate the submission. If a signature looks pixelated or unclear after placement, redraw it at a larger size before shrinking to fit the signature line. Save a copy of the completed form before submitting it to maintain your own records of what was signed and when."}
