{"p2":"Upload a video file containing audio you want to remove. The tool extracts the video stream while discarding the audio track entirely, creating a silent version using browser-based processing. No re-encoding of the visual component occurs, so video quality remains identical to the source. Processing completes in seconds for most files. Download the muted video, which plays silently across all media players and platforms. The original file stays on your device unchanged.","p3":"Social media users mute videos with copyrighted music before uploading to platforms that flag audio copyright violations. Privacy-conscious creators remove background conversations or identifying audio from footage before sharing publicly. Screen recorders strip accidental microphone audio from tutorial videos when narration wasn't intended. Video editors create silent B-roll clips for layering custom music or voiceover in editing software. Content moderators mute inappropriate or offensive audio while preserving the visual content.","p4":"Mute the video before adding new audio in editing software to avoid mixing unwanted original sound with your soundtrack. Verify the muted video actually has no audio track by checking file properties or playing at max volume. Use this tool for removing entire audio tracks; trim or cut audio tools work better for removing specific segments. For videos with multiple audio tracks, this removes all of them rather than selectively deleting one. Export the muted file and check playback before deleting the original, as some formats may behave unexpectedly without audio metadata."}
