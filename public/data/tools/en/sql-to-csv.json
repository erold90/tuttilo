{"p2":"Paste SQL INSERT statements into the input area—the tool extracts table name, column names, and all value rows automatically. Multiple INSERT statements are parsed together, with rows concatenated into a single CSV output. Column names are detected from the INSERT syntax and become CSV headers. String values are properly quoted and escaped in the output. Numeric and boolean values are preserved without quotes. Click Copy to get the CSV result or download it as a file. Processing is entirely client-side for data privacy.","p3":"Database administrators convert SQL dumps into CSV for analysis in spreadsheet tools without restoring entire databases. Data analysts receive SQL exports from colleagues and need tabular format for pivot tables or charting. Migration engineers extract data from SQL backups to import into NoSQL systems that accept CSV. Developers compare database states by converting SQL snapshots to CSV for diff tools.","p4":"Ensure your INSERT statements use explicit column lists—INSERT INTO table (col1, col2) VALUES—or the parser may fail to generate proper headers. Multi-row INSERT syntax (VALUES (1,2),(3,4)) is fully supported and more efficient than separate statements. Watch for SQL strings containing commas or quotes—they should appear properly escaped in the CSV output. If conversion fails, check for syntax errors like missing parentheses or unmatched quotes. Test with a small sample before processing large dumps."}
