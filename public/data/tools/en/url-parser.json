{"p2":"Paste a full URL into the input field and the parser breaks it into labeled components: protocol (http/https), hostname, port (if specified), pathname, query parameters (as key-value pairs), and hash fragment. Each component is displayed separately for easy reading. Query parameters are parsed into individual fields with clear separation of keys and values. The tool handles complex URLs with special characters, encoded entities, and multiple parameters. URL parsing occurs entirely in your browser using native browser APIs.","p3":"Web developers debug routing issues by parsing URLs to verify which path and parameters are actually being sent. QA engineers extract query parameters from failing requests to reproduce bugs with exact inputs. SEO specialists analyze URL structure to ensure clean, readable paths for search engines. Security researchers examine URLs from phishing attempts to identify suspicious domains or encoded payloads hidden in parameters.","p4":"Port numbers are often implicit—80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS—and won't appear unless explicitly specified in the URL. Query parameter order doesn't affect functionality but may matter for caching or server-side logic. URL encoding (%20 for spaces) is decoded automatically; if you need raw encoded values, check the original URL string. Hash fragments (#section) aren't sent to the server—they're processed client-side only. When testing APIs, verify that special characters in parameters are properly encoded (& within values should be %26)."}
