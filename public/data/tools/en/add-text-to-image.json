Position the text by dragging it anywhere on the canvas. Add more layers by clicking the add button again, building up multiple text elements with different styles, sizes, and positions. Each layer can be edited or deleted independently. When satisfied, download the composite image as a PNG with all text permanently rendered onto the original photo.","p3":"Event organizers overlay dates, times, and venue details onto promotional photos for flyers and social media graphics. Educators annotate diagrams or historical photos with labels, arrows, and explanatory notes for classroom presentations. Real estate agents add property details, prices, and contact information directly onto listing photos. Quote creators superimpose inspirational text over scenic backgrounds for Pinterest and Instagram posts. Product designers mock up UI text on app screenshots before sending to developers.","p4":"Layer your text elements in order of importance: large headlines first, supporting details second, fine print last. Use contrasting font weights and sizes to establish visual hierarchy and guide the viewer's eye. Add a subtle shadow or outline to text placed over busy backgrounds to prevent readability issues. Stick to two or three complementary fonts maximum to avoid a cluttered, amateurish look. Align text to invisible grid lines or image elements for a polished, professional composition. Export at 2x resolution if the image will be viewed on retina displays or printed."}
