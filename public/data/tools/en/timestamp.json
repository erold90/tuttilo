{"p2":"The tool displays a live clock showing the current Unix timestamp in both seconds and milliseconds, updating every second. Enter any Unix timestamp in the converter field to see the corresponding human-readable date and time in your local timezone. Conversely, select a date and time using the datetime picker to instantly get its Unix timestamp equivalent. Toggle between seconds and milliseconds formats depending on whether your system uses standard Unix time or JavaScript-style timestamps. All conversions calculate in your browser using JavaScript's Date object.","p3":"Backend developers debug log files containing Unix timestamps by converting them to readable dates to understand event sequences. Database administrators working with SQL TIMESTAMP columns convert between Unix integers and ISO date strings for queries. API engineers test endpoint responses containing timestamps by verifying that the Unix values correspond to expected dates and times. System administrators investigating server logs translate Unix timestamps to human dates to correlate events across different logging systems.","p4":"Remember that Unix timestamps are always in UTC, so when converting to human-readable format, consider timezone offsets if your application displays local times. JavaScript timestamps use milliseconds while most backend systems use seconds, so multiply or divide by 1000 as appropriate. When storing timestamps in databases, prefer integer Unix timestamps over string dates for efficient indexing and timezone-independent storage. If you're getting invalid dates, check whether your timestamp is in seconds or milliseconds; pasting a seconds-based timestamp into a milliseconds field will produce a date in 1970.","seo":"Convert between Unix timestamps and human-readable dates. Live clock shows current timestamp. Supports seconds and milliseconds. Convert dates to timestamps and vice versa."}
