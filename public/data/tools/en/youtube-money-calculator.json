{"p2":"Enter your estimated daily view count and expected CPM (cost per thousand views) rate. CPM varies widely by niche, geography, and audience demographics — typical ranges are $0.25-$4 for developing markets, $2-$8 for general content in developed markets, and $8-$20+ for finance, business, or tech channels. The calculator multiplies your daily views by CPM and applies YouTube's 55/45 revenue split (creators get 55%) to estimate daily, monthly, and yearly earnings. Adjust inputs to model growth scenarios or compare different CPM assumptions. All calculations happen locally in your browser.","p3":"Aspiring YouTubers research realistic income expectations by calculating earnings at various view count milestones before deciding whether to pursue content creation full-time. Existing creators validate whether their actual AdSense revenue aligns with industry benchmarks or indicates they should optimize for higher-CPM content. Brands evaluating influencer partnerships estimate a channel's revenue to determine fair sponsorship rates relative to a creator's ad income. Financial advisors helping content creator clients model income streams and tax planning using view count trends and CPM averages.","p4":"CPM varies dramatically by content type: finance and business average $12-$25, tech and gadgets $7-$15, gaming and entertainment $2-$6, and vlogs or lifestyle $1-$5. Geography matters — US traffic commands 3-5x higher CPM than traffic from developing nations. YouTube takes 45% of ad revenue, so a $10 CPM means you actually earn $5.50 per thousand views. RPM (revenue per thousand) shown in YouTube Analytics already accounts for the 55/45 split and is lower than CPM. Factor in that only 40-60% of views are monetized due to ad blockers and viewers in non-monetizable countries."}
