{"p2":"Load your image and select a crop preset like 1:1 for Instagram squares, 16:9 for video thumbnails, or 4:3 for traditional photos. Drag the selection box to frame the portion you want to keep, then fine-tune by moving corners or edges. For profile pictures, switch to circle crop mode to create a round cutout. The tool renders the cropped result instantly in your browser without uploading to any server. Download the final image in PNG format with transparency preserved for circular crops.","p3":"Social media managers crop photos to fit each platform's feed ratio, turning landscape shots into 1:1 squares for Instagram or 9:16 vertical stories. Photographers reframe compositions by removing distracting edges or adjusting the focal point for different print sizes. Avatar creators use circle crop to isolate faces for Discord, Slack, or forum profiles. Product photographers crop items tightly to remove background clutter before listing on marketplaces. Thumbnail designers extract specific sections from wide screenshots to create clickable previews.","p4":"Align your subject on the rule-of-thirds intersection points before cropping for more dynamic compositions. Use the freeform tool when you need unusual ratios, but stick to presets for consistency across a photo series. Circle crop works best when the subject's face or object is centered and fills at least 60% of the circular area. Export at higher resolution than needed, then let your target platform downscale for sharper results. For print, crop to the exact paper aspect ratio to avoid awkward white borders or cuts at the print shop."}
