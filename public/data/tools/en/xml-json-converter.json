{"p2":"Select your conversion direction—XML to JSON or JSON to XML—then paste your data into the input area. For XML inputs, the tool parses element names as object keys, text content as values, and preserves attributes as special properties. When converting JSON to XML, object keys become element names and arrays generate repeated sibling elements. The converter handles nested structures automatically, maintaining hierarchy in both formats. Processing runs entirely in your browser using native parsing APIs, ensuring your configuration files or API responses remain private.","p3":"API developers encounter XML responses from legacy SOAP services that need conversion to JSON for modern REST clients. Frontend engineers working with SVG files convert them to JSON for manipulation before rendering. DevOps teams transform XML configuration files from older systems into JSON for container orchestration tools. Data analysts receive XML exports from enterprise systems and convert them to JSON for easier processing with JavaScript-based analytics tools.","p4":"XML attributes often become special keys in JSON (like @attribute or $attribute)—know your converter's convention before integrating the output. Namespaces in XML can cause unexpected nesting in JSON; strip them beforehand if they're not semantically important. When converting JSON arrays to XML, ensure your target system can handle repeated sibling elements rather than expecting a wrapper element. Self-closing XML tags should produce empty strings in JSON, not null values. Test round-trip conversion with sample data to verify structural fidelity."}
