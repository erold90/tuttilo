{"p2":"Paste your SQL query into the editor and choose between beautify or minify modes. Beautify mode adds proper indentation, splits clauses onto separate lines, and automatically converts keywords to uppercase for consistency. Minify mode does the opposite, compressing your query to a single line by removing excess whitespace while preserving functionality. The tool supports SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE TABLE, and other common SQL statements. All formatting happens in your browser, so your database queries never leave your device.","p3":"Database administrators use this when working with queries extracted from application logs or ORM-generated SQL that lacks formatting. Developers preparing SQL for code reviews find the beautifier essential for making complex joins and subqueries readable. Teams with coding standards requiring uppercase keywords rely on the auto-capitalization feature. When embedding SQL in configuration files or API requests where space matters, the minifier reduces payload size without affecting query execution.","p4":"Always beautify queries before committing them to version control—diffs become meaningful when formatting is consistent. For debugging slow queries, formatted SQL makes it easier to spot missing indexes or inefficient subqueries in execution plans. When copying formatted SQL into email or documentation, use monospace fonts to preserve indentation. If your formatter output looks wrong, check for unmatched parentheses or missing semicolons in the original query. Use the minifier strategically for production WHERE clauses in URLs, but keep development versions beautified."}
