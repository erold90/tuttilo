{"p2":"Use the corner control toggles to work with all four corners linked together for uniform rounding, or unlink them to set each corner independently. Drag the slider or type values directly, then choose your preferred unit: pixels for fixed sizing, percentages for responsive scaling, or rems for accessibility-friendly sizing that respects user font preferences. The preview box updates in real-time showing exactly how your element will appear. Copy the generated CSS with a single click — it includes the full border-radius property with individual corner values when they differ.","p3":"Button designers round corners to create friendly, approachable interface elements that feel more touchable than harsh rectangular edges. Card layouts use subtle radius (4-8px) on content containers for modern, polished aesthetics that distinguish sections without heavy borders. Profile pictures and avatar components use 50% border-radius to transform square images into perfect circles. Design systems implement consistent radius scales (2px, 4px, 8px, 16px) across components to maintain visual harmony, and this tool helps visualize each step of that scale.","p4":"Setting border-radius to 50% creates a perfect circle only when the element has equal width and height — use this for avatar images. For pill-shaped buttons, use a radius equal to half the button's height (if height is 40px, use 20px radius). When applying different radii to individual corners, maintain visual balance by keeping opposite corners similar. Percentage-based radius scales with element size, making it ideal for responsive components that resize at different breakpoints. Combining border-radius with overflow: hidden clips child content cleanly, essential when rounding containers with background images or nested elements."}
