{"p2":"Upload any standard PDF and the tool converts it to PDF/A-1b format, an ISO-standardized archival variant designed for long-term preservation. The conversion embeds all fonts, images, and content directly into the file, removes external dependencies, and adds conformance metadata that archival systems recognize. PDF/A files are self-contained and don't rely on external resources that might become unavailable over time. All conversion happens in your browser, keeping archival documents containing historical records or proprietary information private on your device during the standardization process.","p3":"Corporate archivists convert business records to PDF/A format to comply with document retention regulations requiring specific preservation standards. Legal departments convert executed contracts to PDF/A for long-term storage in compliance with statute-of-limitations requirements. Government agencies convert public records to PDF/A before submitting to national archives for permanent preservation. Healthcare organizations convert patient medical records to PDF/A to meet HIPAA-compliant archival storage standards. University libraries convert digitized rare manuscripts to PDF/A format to ensure accessibility decades into the future as technology evolves.","p4":"PDF/A files are larger than standard PDFs because all fonts and resources are embedded—expect size increases of 10-30% depending on original file complexity. Some advanced PDF features like JavaScript, encryption, and multimedia don't transfer to PDF/A since they're not allowed in the archival standard. Verify converted files meet your organization's specific PDF/A compliance requirements, as variations like PDF/A-2 and PDF/A-3 have different feature sets. Use PDF/A for final archival versions rather than working documents, since the format prioritizes preservation over editability. Test that archived files open correctly in PDF/A validators to confirm conformance before committing to long-term storage."}
