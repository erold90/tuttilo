{"p2":"Paste your text into the input field and select the desired case format from the buttons: UPPERCASE for all caps, lowercase for no caps, Title Case for capitalized words, camelCase for variable names, PascalCase for class names, snake_case for database columns, kebab-case for URLs, or CONSTANT_CASE for environment variables. The tool applies the transformation instantly using JavaScript string manipulation, displaying the converted result below. Copy the output with one click. The conversion preserves all characters while changing only letter case and spacing.","p3":"Programmers convert variable names between coding conventions when refactoring code or migrating between languages with different style guides. Content creators fix accidentally-capslock text without retyping entire paragraphs. SEO specialists generate kebab-case slugs from article titles for clean, readable URLs. Database administrators convert table or column names to snake_case for SQL convention compliance. Copywriters transform headlines to Title Case for consistent formatting across marketing materials and social media posts.","p4":"Use camelCase and PascalCase for JavaScript variables and classes, snake_case for Python and Ruby, and kebab-case for CSS classes. CONSTANT_CASE signals global constants or environment variables in most programming languages. Avoid Title Case for technical documentation titles, which typically use sentence case instead. For URLs, prefer kebab-case over underscores, as search engines treat hyphens as word separators but not underscores. Double-check conversions that include special characters or numbers, as some converters may handle them inconsistently."}
