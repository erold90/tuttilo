{"p2":"Click the start button and your browser prompts you to choose what to record: entire screen, specific application window, or individual browser tab. Select your preference and optionally enable microphone audio to capture narration. The recorder captures frames in real-time using browser APIs, displaying a live timer and waveform if audio is enabled. Click stop when finished, and the tool compiles the recording into a downloadable video file. Everything processes locally without transmitting any data to external servers.","p3":"Software developers record bug reproductions to send to support teams, showing exact click paths and error states. Tutorial creators capture step-by-step software walkthroughs for YouTube or online course platforms. Remote workers record screen presentations when unable to attend live meetings, creating shareable async updates. Customer support agents demonstrate solutions to user questions by recording their screen while navigating the product. Educators create lecture captures by recording slides and narration simultaneously from their computer.","p4":"Close unnecessary browser tabs and applications before recording to prevent sensitive information from appearing in the capture. Test your microphone level with a short recording before starting a long session to avoid silent or distorted audio. Record at your display's native resolution, then downscale the video afterward if needed for smaller file sizes. Use tab recording instead of full screen when demonstrating web applications to exclude desktop notifications or distractions. Pause and resume instead of stopping and restarting to keep your recording in a single file without editing."}
