{"p2":"Enter Markdown syntax in the input field and the tool converts it to semantic HTML in real time. The output includes proper HTML tags: # becomes <h1>, ** wraps text in <strong>, links become <a> tags with href attributes, and code blocks generate <pre><code> structures. You can see both the raw HTML and a rendered preview side by side. Copy the HTML output directly for embedding in web pages or CMSs that accept HTML input. The conversion follows CommonMark specifications and processes entirely in your browser for privacy.","p3":"Content managers publishing to CMSs like WordPress or Drupal draft in Markdown for speed, then convert to HTML for pasting into visual editors. Email marketers who need clean HTML for newsletters write content in readable Markdown syntax, convert it, then paste the HTML into email campaign tools. Developers generating static HTML pages from Markdown content use this to preview how their final markup will look. Technical documentation teams verify that their Markdown files produce valid, semantic HTML before pushing to production sites.","p4":"Remember that most CMSs wrap your pasted HTML in additional div containers, so avoid adding unnecessary wrapper elements in your Markdown. Use inline HTML within your Markdown for elements that Markdown doesn't support natively, like tables or specific attributes. Test image links in both the Markdown and final HTML to ensure paths work in your target environment. If you plan to style the output, add classes to headings and other elements using inline HTML syntax like <h2 class=\"custom\">Title</h2> mixed with Markdown."}
