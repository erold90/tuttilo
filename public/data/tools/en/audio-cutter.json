{"p2":"Upload an audio file and view the waveform visualization that represents amplitude over time. Drag the left marker to set your start point and the right marker to define the end point, isolating the segment you want to keep. Click play to preview the selected portion and verify it sounds correct. Adjust markers for precision down to fractions of a second using the waveform peaks as visual guides. The tool extracts the selected audio segment using browser processing, then lets you download the trimmed file.","p3":"Podcasters trim silence, mistakes, or long pauses from interview recordings before publishing episodes. Musicians extract specific instrumental sections or vocal takes from longer jam session recordings. Sound designers isolate individual sound effects from field recordings for use in video or game projects. Language teachers cut audio clips from full-length lessons to create targeted listening exercises. Content creators remove intros or outros from royalty-free music tracks to fit specific video lengths.","p4":"Zoom in on the waveform to identify precise cut points, especially when removing breaths or clicks between words. Leave a fraction of a second before the first sound and after the last sound to avoid cutting words or notes abruptly. For music, cut at zero-crossing points where the waveform intersects the center line to prevent pops or clicks. Use the play preview repeatedly to confirm the cut sounds natural without awkward starts or stops. Export in the same format as the source file when possible to avoid unnecessary re-encoding and quality loss."}
