{"p2":"Type your text, URL, or any string data into the input field. The QR code generates immediately in the preview area as you type. Adjust the size slider to change the output dimensions from small to large. Use the error correction dropdown to set recovery level—higher levels let the QR code still scan correctly even if partially damaged or dirty. Customize foreground and background colors using the color pickers, though high contrast between them ensures better scanning reliability. Click download to save the QR code as a PNG image. All generation happens in your browser using the qrcode.js library.","p3":"Restaurant owners generate QR codes linking to digital menus, printing them on table tents so customers can browse without physical menus. Event organizers create QR codes containing venue addresses or registration URLs for posters and email confirmations. Retail businesses embed QR codes on product packaging that link to setup instructions or promotional offers. Teachers generate QR codes for homework submission links or classroom resources, printing them on worksheets so students can quickly access materials on their devices.","p4":"Use high error correction (30 percent) if the QR code will be printed on textured surfaces or displayed outdoors where it might accumulate dirt or damage. Test scanning your generated QR code with multiple phones and apps before mass printing to ensure compatibility across devices. For URLs, use a link shortener first to create smaller QR codes that are easier to scan; fewer data points mean larger pixels and better scanning at a distance. Stick with black foreground and white background unless branding absolutely requires colors—some scanning apps struggle with low-contrast or unconventional color combinations.","seo":"Generate custom QR codes from any text or URL directly in your browser.
