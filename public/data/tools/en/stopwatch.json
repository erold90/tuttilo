{"p2":"Click the start button to begin timing with precision down to centiseconds (hundredths of a second). The display shows minutes, seconds, and centiseconds updating in real-time. Hit the lap button during running timing to record split times without stopping the overall counter. All splits are saved in a list showing both individual lap duration and cumulative total time. Stop the timer when finished, and reset to clear all data and return to zero. Tuttilo runs the stopwatch entirely in your browser using high-precision performance timing APIs.","p3":"Track runners record split times for each lap during training runs to analyze pace consistency and identify improvement areas. Competitive gamers time speedrun attempts with lap markers for each level or checkpoint completion. Scientists measure reaction times in experiments requiring precise timing measurements below one-second resolution. Cooking enthusiasts time multiple dishes simultaneously using lap markers to coordinate complex meal preparations with perfect synchronization.","p4":"Use the lap function proactively to capture timestamps even if you think you might not need them—you can always ignore extra data later. For very precise measurements, minimize other browser activity to reduce timing interference from resource-intensive tabs. Record your initial reaction time by testing how quickly you can hit the stop button after start to account for human delay in other measurements. Review lap times immediately after stopping since some browsers may clear data if you navigate away from the page without noting results.","p5":"Yes, the stopwatch uses JavaScript's performance.now() API which provides microsecond precision. However, display is limited to centiseconds (10ms) for practical readability. Actual precision depends on your device's performance characteristics."}
