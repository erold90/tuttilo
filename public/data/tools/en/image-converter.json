{"p2":"Drag any image file and the tool automatically detects its format, then lets you select JPG, PNG, or WebP as the output format. Quality sliders control compression level for JPG and WebP formats, balancing file size against visual fidelity. The converter handles diverse input formats including SVG, HEIC, AVIF, TIFF, and ICO, making it easy to transform photos from cameras, screenshots, or graphics from design tools into web-compatible formats. All conversion processing happens in your browser using client-side Canvas API, ensuring images containing personal photos or proprietary designs never upload to external servers.","p3":"Photographers convert iPhone HEIC photos to JPG for compatibility with Windows computers and older photo editing software. Web developers convert PNG screenshots with transparency to WebP for faster page loading without visual quality loss. Graphic designers convert SVG logos to high-resolution PNG for use in applications that don't support vector formats. Social media managers convert AVIF images from modern cameras to JPG for platforms that don't yet support newer formats. Bloggers convert large TIFF screenshots to compressed JPG to reduce storage requirements in content management systems.","p4":"Use PNG for images requiring transparency or sharp text/graphics with solid colors, while JPG works better for photographs where compression artifacts are less noticeable. WebP typically offers 25-35% smaller file sizes than JPG at equivalent quality levels, though older browsers may not support it. When converting to JPG, start with 85-90% quality—higher settings produce minimal visual improvement but significantly larger files. For batch conversions, test settings on one representative image first rather than processing hundreds only to find quality is too low or files too large. If converting for print, keep originals in lossless formats and only convert to compressed formats for final delivery."}
