The note persists across browser sessions until you manually clear it or your browser data. A live counter at the bottom tracks word and character count as you type. Use the download button to export your current note as a plain text file to your computer. The clear button wipes the saved note and resets the editor. Since everything runs locally, your notes never leave your device.","p3":"Quick note-takers use this when they need to jot down ideas, phone numbers, or temporary information during browsing without opening a separate application. Developers paste error messages or command output here to review them later or copy portions selectively. Writers draft short-form content like tweets or email replies in a distraction-free environment with automatic saving. Students working on shared computers can draft assignment text without installing software, then download it before logging out.","p4":"Treat this as a temporary scratchpad rather than long-term storage since browser data can be cleared unexpectedly by system cleanups or privacy tools. For important content, download to a file regularly rather than relying solely on local storage. If you work across multiple browsers, remember the auto-save only works within the same browser you started in. Use the character counter to stay within limits for platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn posts, or meta descriptions that have strict length requirements.","seo":"Free online notepad with auto-save.
