{"p2":"Upload a PDF and the tool converts each page into a high-resolution PNG image file that you can download individually or as a complete ZIP archive. Each page renders at print-quality resolution suitable for presentations, web publishing, or image editing. This differs from extracting embedded images—instead, it captures the entire page layout including text, graphics, and formatting as a complete visual snapshot. All image extraction happens in your browser, keeping documents containing proprietary designs or confidential content private on your device during the conversion process.","p3":"Designers extract presentation slides as images to insert into portfolio websites showcasing client work. Social media managers convert infographic pages into shareable image posts for Instagram and LinkedIn. Teachers extract worksheet pages as images to upload to learning management systems that don't support direct PDF embedding. Event organizers convert schedule pages into images for mobile app integration where PDF viewers aren't available. Bloggers extract diagram pages from technical PDFs to embed as illustrations in tutorial articles.","p4":"PNG format preserves text clarity and sharp edges better than JPG, though file sizes are larger—use PNG for text-heavy pages and JPG for photograph-heavy content. The tool renders pages at screen resolution by default; for print use or large displays, check if higher DPI export options are available. Extracting every page of a large document creates many files—use selective extraction if you only need specific pages rather than the entire document. Extracted images are static snapshots, so hyperlinks and interactive PDF features won't work in the image versions. If you need to edit extracted content, consider using dedicated image editing software rather than trying to modify text directly in the PNG files."}
