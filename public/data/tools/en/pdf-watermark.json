{"p2":"Type your watermark text and adjust font size, opacity, rotation angle, and positioning to create either subtle branding or prominent copyright protection. The watermark applies to all pages simultaneously with consistent placement and styling. You can make watermarks nearly transparent for background branding or highly opaque to prevent unauthorized use of documents. All watermarking happens locally in your browser, keeping proprietary presentations and confidential reports private on your device while adding protection layers.","p3":"Photographers watermark portfolio PDFs with copyright notices before sending work samples to potential clients to discourage unauthorized use. Consultants add \"Confidential Draft\" watermarks to proposal versions shared during client review to prevent premature external distribution. Real estate agencies watermark property listing PDFs with agency branding to maintain attribution when agents share materials with buyers. Academic researchers watermark preprint PDFs with \"Not for Distribution\" labels before circulating to peer reviewers. Law firms watermark discovery document PDFs with case numbers and confidentiality designations for organized case management.","p4":"Set watermark opacity between 20-40% for subtle background branding that doesn't interfere with document readability, or use 80-100% for prominent protection on sensitive materials. Diagonal watermarks across page centers are harder to crop out than those placed in corners. Test watermark visibility on both screen and printed versions since opacity appears differently in each medium. For copyright protection, include the copyright symbol, year, and rights holder name rather than just generic \"Confidential\" text. Avoid placing watermarks over critical content areas like charts, tables, or signature lines where they might obscure important information."}
