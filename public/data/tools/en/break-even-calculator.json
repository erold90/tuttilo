{"p2":"Enter your total fixed costs (rent, salaries, insurance—expenses that don't change with production volume), your price per unit that customers pay, and your variable cost per unit (materials, direct labor—costs that scale with each item produced). Tuttilo instantly calculates how many units you must sell to break even, where total revenue exactly equals total costs. You'll also see the break-even revenue and contribution margin (price minus variable cost). The tool displays a visual chart showing the break-even point. Your business financial data is processed entirely in your browser.","p3":"Entrepreneurs launching new products determine minimum viable sales volumes before committing to production. Restaurant owners calculate how many covers they need daily to cover rent, payroll, and utilities. Freelance consultants set their rates by understanding how many billable hours they need to cover business expenses. Event planners price tickets for conferences by calculating attendee numbers needed to cover venue and catering costs. Manufacturing businesses evaluate whether new equipment purchases will pay for themselves based on increased production capacity.","p4":"Breaking even is the bare minimum for survival—target a sales volume significantly above break-even to generate profit and handle unexpected expenses. Fixed costs aren't always truly fixed; many \"fixed\" expenses like salaries or rent can change at certain volume thresholds, creating stepped break-even points. Lowering variable costs through better supplier negotiations or process improvements decreases your break-even point more predictably than trying to raise prices. Consider that break-even analysis assumes you can sell all units produced—factor in realistic sales conversion rates and inventory waste for more conservative planning."}
