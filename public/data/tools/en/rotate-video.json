{"p2":"Upload a video that was recorded in the wrong orientation, common when filming on smartphones without rotation lock. Select the rotation angle: 90° clockwise, 90° counterclockwise, or 180° for upside-down videos. Click rotate and the tool processes the video in your browser, transposing pixel coordinates and adjusting metadata to reflect the new orientation. The output maintains the original video quality without re-encoding compression. Download the corrected video, now oriented properly for normal playback on any device.","p3":"Smartphone users fix vertical videos accidentally recorded in landscape mode or horizontal clips shot upside-down. Content creators correct footage from mounted cameras that were installed at the wrong angle. Video archivists rotate old VHS transfers that were digitized in incorrect orientation. Social media managers adjust videos to match platform requirements, rotating landscape videos to portrait for Instagram Stories. Drone pilots correct footage from cameras that tilted during flight or were mounted incorrectly before takeoff.","p4":"Check the original video metadata before rotating, as some players automatically rotate based on embedded orientation flags. Rotate only once to avoid cumulative quality loss from multiple re-encoding passes. For mobile videos, rotate to match the intended viewing orientation rather than the recording orientation. Verify the rotated video's width and height match your expectations, especially if rotating between landscape and portrait. Save the original file if you're unsure about the correct rotation, since reversing the process requires another re-encode."}
