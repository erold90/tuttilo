{"p2":"Select which user agents to configure, starting with the wildcard (*) that applies to all crawlers or specific bots like Googlebot and Bingbot. Define allowed and disallowed paths using URL patterns, add crawl delays if needed, and specify your sitemap location. The generator creates a properly formatted robots.txt file following standard protocol syntax. Everything runs in your browser with no server uploads. Download the finished file and upload it to your website's root directory for search engines to discover.","p3":"Website administrators prevent search engines from indexing duplicate content in staging or development directories. E-commerce sites block crawlers from accessing internal search result pages that create infinite URL variations. Content sites protect admin areas and private sections while allowing public pages to be indexed freely. SEO specialists set crawl rate limits on large sites to prevent server overload from aggressive bot traffic.","p4":"Place your robots.txt file only in the root domain directory—subdirectories are ignored by crawlers. Use specific disallow rules rather than blocking entire sections when possible to maintain granular control. Test your robots.txt file with Google Search Console's robots.txt Tester before deploying to catch syntax errors. Remember that robots.txt is advisory, not security—malicious bots may ignore it, so never rely on it to protect sensitive data. Include your XML sitemap URL to help search engines discover all your important pages efficiently.","p5":"While most major search engines respect robots.txt directives, it's not enforceable. Reputable crawlers follow the rules, but malicious bots often ignore them. Never use robots.txt for security—protect sensitive areas with proper authentication instead."}
