A 25% margin means /bin/zsh.25 of every dollar earned is profit.","q2":"What is the difference between margin and markup?","a2":"Margin is profit/revenue, markup is profit/cost.

Retail: 2-5%, Software: 20-40%, Services: 15-25%. Higher margins generally indicate better pricing power and efficiency.","q4":"How do I calculate price from target margin?","a4":"Price = Cost ÷ (1 - Margin/100).
