Documents with many images typically see the largest reductions, often 50-80% smaller. Text-heavy PDFs may see smaller reductions.","q2":"Does compression reduce the quality of my PDF?","a2":"The tool uses smart compression that targets embedded images while preserving text sharpness. The result is visually very close to the original in most cases.","q3":"Can I compress password-protected PDFs?","a3":"Password-protected PDFs need to be unlocked first. Use our Unlock PDF tool to remove the protection, then compress the file.","q4":"Will compressing a PDF reduce its quality?","a4":"The compression algorithm is designed to minimize quality loss while maximizing file size reduction. For text-based PDFs, compression typically has no visible impact on quality. For image-heavy PDFs, you may notice slight quality reduction at higher compression levels, but the tool intelligently balances compression and quality to maintain readability.","q5":"Can I compress password-protected or encrypted PDFs?","a5":"No, password-protected or encrypted PDFs must be unlocked before compression.
